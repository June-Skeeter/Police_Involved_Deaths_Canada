# Content Warning:
I will be speaking about police violence today.  This difficult and painful subject may be triggering to some, especially BIPOC individuals.

# Notes on Terminology

**Police Killling:** A death directly resulting from police use of force.  Including but not limited to: shooting, tassing, other use of force, or incompetence (eg. car accidents).

**Police-Involved Deaths**  Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police is considred a police-involved death.  Includes police killings as well as deaths resulting from police negligence/inaction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergenices, etc.  This is broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics.
