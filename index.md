# Police Involved Deaths in Canada

###  Presnetation by June Skeeter

## Content Warning:
I will be speaking about police violence today, difficult and painful subject that may be triggering to some people, especially BIPOC individuals.


# Land acknowledgement
Before beginning, its important to acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located.  I am speaking to you today from the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), səl̓ilwətaɁɬ təməxʷ (Tsleil-Waututh), Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Temíx̱w (Squamish) Nations.

I encourage each of you to take a moment to explore [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/).  This is by no means a definitive source, but its a good place to start building an understanding of the indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.

# A few notes on terminology

**Police Killling:** A death directly resulting from police use of force.  Including but not limited to: shooting, tassing, other use of force, or incompetence (eg. car accidents)

**Police Involved Deaths**  Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police is considred a police involved death.  Includes police killings as well as deaths resulting from police negligence/inacction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergenices, etc.  A broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics.
