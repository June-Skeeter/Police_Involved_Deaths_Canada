# Deadly Force

The most comprehensive publicly avalialbe dataset on police killings in Canada is the [Deadly Force database](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/fatalpoliceencounters/) was publisehd July 23rd 2020.

* *"There is no government database listing deaths at the hands of the police available to the public in Canada, so CBC News created its own. The CBCâ€™s research librarians have collected detailed information on each case, such as ethnicity, the role of mental illness or substance abuse, the type of weapon used and the police service involved, to create a picture of who is dying in police encounters."*

# Irregular Updates

The dataset was intially published in [2018](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform-custom/deadly-force), covering incidents from 2000 to 2017.  It wasn't updated again two and a half years.

* The updates coincided wite media attention surrounding the Black Lives Matter protests in summer 2020, and to date the CBC has no plans of updating it further.

* A key issue with relying on a news corporation to collect this information, is that it is not updated at regular intervals.
	* Once the subject falls out of the news cycle, they have little incentive to continue.


# Missing & Incomplete Records

Because it is a collection of secondhand information (eg. press releases and news stories), many of the records are incomplete.
	* The race of the victim is unknown in 136/554 incidents.
	* The victims name is unknown in 45 incidetns.
	* The cause of death is unknown in 22 incidents.

The CBC database has missing incidnets entirely.  Including four shootings [1](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2014/05/21/jeffrey-reodica-vigil-marks-10-years-since-fatal-police-shooting/) [2](https://globalnews.ca/news/7643929/former-b-c-cop-granted-escorted-temporary-absences/) [3](https://globalnews.ca/news/6267867/asirt-shooting-cochrane-dec-2019/) [4](https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/man-dead-after-police-involved-shooting-in-central-alberta-officials-1.4747826), a death from a police dog [5](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/prince-george-death-rcmp-custody-investigation-1.5540688), and two [starlight tours](https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/the-police-4-starlight-tours/).

I reached out to the CBC for comment on why the deaths of Rodney Naistus and Lawrence Wegner in January and February [2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon_freezing_deaths#Incidents):
* *"While their deaths were very likely a result of starlight tours by the Saskatoon police, they were not added to the database because there is no record of police officers picking them up. The inquests into their deaths were also inconclusive. Because of the lack of definitive proof, it was decided not to include them in the database."*

# Looking to the United States
In the US, there is a non-profit organization, [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/), which maintains a database and updates it frequently.
* *We believe the data represented on this site is the most comprehensive accounting of people killed by police since 2013. ... more comprehensive than the Washington Post police shootings database: ... includes additional incidents such as cases where police kill someone through use of a chokehold, baton, taser or other means as well as cases such as killings by off-duty police.*

# Exapnding the Dataset and Filling Gaps
The Deadly Force dataset only includes deaths that are "verifiably" the result of police use of force during an arrest.  This does not capture the full picture, we need a broader, more inclusive account of all deaths that are occuring as a result of interactions with the police in Canada. 

### 1) Killings by off duty & ex police officers.
* Domestic violence rates among police families are [two to four](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/police-officers-who-hit-their-wives-or-girlfriends/380329/) times higher than they are in the general public
	* At least three Candian police have been convicted of killing their partners since 2000 [1](https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/10/31/wills_found_guilty_of_murdering_mistress.html) [2](https://globalnews.ca/news/7643929/former-b-c-cop-granted-escorted-temporary-absences/) [3](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ex-rcmp-officer-convicted-of-murder-1.305479)
	

### 2) Deaths resulting from police negligecne, incompetence, and prejucide.  Including those occuring in police custody.
* There are multiple incindents where police have unintentionally killed people with their vehicles [1](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/man-dies-police-custody-puvirnituq-1.4091914) [2](https://barrie.ctvnews.ca/pedestrian-struck-and-killed-by-an-unmarked-opp-vehicle-in-midland-1.5124667?cache=) [3](https://www.bei.gouv.qc.ca/actualites/detail/mise-a-jour-concernant-levenement-survenu-a-mont-laurier-le-13-octobre-lidentite-du-civil-decede.html)
* There are many records of indivuduals in police custody being denied medical care.
	* In one horrific case, Paul Kayuryuk from [Baker Lake, NU](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/paul-kayuryuk-baker-lake-inquest-1.4231300) died after being found unconcious at the landfill.  Paul was diabetic had suffered a stroke but the police assumed he was intoxicated and kept him in a jail cell overnight.
* Suicides in police custody are [oftentimes preventable](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/womans-death-in-custody-exposes-indigenous-policing-issues/article32694835/).
* Two men burned to death in a jail cell [while being held for public intoxication at the ramshackle Kashechewan First Nation police detachment](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kashechewan-fire-inquest-calls-for-more-funds-for-police-stations-training-1.819764)
