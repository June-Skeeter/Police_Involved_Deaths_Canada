# Deadly Force (2020)

This dataset covers January 2000 to June 2020 and was collected by the [CBC](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/fatalpoliceencounters/).  

* *"There is no government database listing deaths at the hands of the police available to the public in Canada, so CBC News created its own. The CBCâ€™s research librarians have collected detailed information on each case, such as ethnicity, the role of mental illness or substance abuse, the type of weapon used and the police service involved, to create a picture of who is dying in police encounters."*

* This database is a collection of secondhand information (eg. press releases), and is an undercount of the true number of incidents.

# Jumping on the bandwagon?

The dataset was intially published in [2018](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform-custom/deadly-force), covering incidents from 2000 to 2017.  It was only updated in summer 2020 in response to the killing of George Floyd.  
* A key issue with relying on a news corporation to collect this information, is that it is not updated at regular intervals.
* Once the subject falls out of the news cycle, they have little incentive to continue.

# Looking to the United States
In the US, there is a non-profit organization, [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/), which maintains a database and updates it frequently.
* *We believe the data represented on this site is the most comprehensive accounting of people killed by police since 2013. Note that the Mapping Police Violence database is more comprehensive than the Washington Post police shootings database: while WaPo only tracks cases where people are fatally shot by on-duty police officers, our database includes additional incidents such as cases where police kill someone through use of a chokehold, baton, taser or other means as well as cases such as killings by off-duty police. A recent report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated approximately 1,200 people were killed by police between June, 2015 and May, 2016. Our database identified 1,104 people killed by police over this time period. While there are undoubtedly police killings that are not included in our database (namely, those that go unreported by the media), these estimates suggest that our database captures 92% of the total number of police killings that have occurred since 2013. We hope these data will be used to provide greater transparency and accountability for police departments as part of the ongoing campaign to end police violence in our communities.*

# Missing Data

The CBC database has missing records and incomplete data.  One glaring example: this dataset does not include the killings of [Rodney Naistus and Lawrence Wegner in January and February 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon_freezing_deaths#Incidents).

* They were victims of ["starlight tours"](https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/the-police-4-starlight-tours/), a heinous practice where police, abduct indigenous people during winter and drop them off in rural areas, leaving them to freeze to death if they couldn't make it home.  

* I reache out to the CBC for comment on why these incidents were ommitted:
  * *"While their deaths were very likely a result of starlight tours by the Saskatoon police, they were not added to the database because there is no record of police officers picking them up. The inquests into their deaths were also inconclusive. Because of the lack of definitive proof, it was decided not to include them in the database."*

# Filling the Gaps
I have added incidents that were omitted in the Deady Force Article and updated it through March 2020 to the best of my abilities.  However, it is difficult to find information regarding police killings (esepecially historically) so my updates are also incomplete.

Despite the incomplete nature of this dataset, I beleive this is the best publicly available record available.
