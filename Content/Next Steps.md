# What's Next?

### Data Validation and Verrificatoin
More work needs to be put into filling gaps in the data
	* There are more incidents, they need to be added
	* The unknonw varibles for existing records need to be filled where possible
	* Add multiple references to verify the records

### Sharing the Data
This data needs to be shared more widely, Systemic Racism is swept under the rug too often in Canada

### Instructional contnent
The workshops are still being refined and updated.  I hope to get them to a point where I can post them on youtube as asynchronous videos to make them more widely accessble.

If any one has any questions, concenrs, comments, or is interested in collaborating on this please contact me at skeeter1@mail.ubc.ca
