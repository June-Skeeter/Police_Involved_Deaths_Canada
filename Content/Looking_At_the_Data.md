# Deadly Force

The most comprehensive publicly available dataset on police killings in Canada is the [Deadly Force database](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/fatalpoliceencounters/) which was initally published in 2018 and updated July 23rd 2020.

* *"There is no government database listing deaths at the hands of the police available to the public in Canada, so CBC News created its own. The CBCâ€™s research librarians have collected detailed information on each case, such as ethnicity, the role of mental illness or substance abuse, the type of weapon used and the police service involved, to create a picture of who is dying in police encounters."*

# Racial Breakdown

Between January 1, 2000 and April 4, 2021 there have been *at least* **603 police-involved deaths in Canada**.  This number is based on updates I've added to the CBC data. 
* To highlight the uneven distribution of deaths across demographic groups, I've calculated the police-involved death rates for each group using 2016 census data.
* The death rates for Indigenous, Black, and White individuals are *at least*: **2.94**, **1.94**, **0.44** deaths / million residents / year respectively.
* The victims' race is Unknown in 153 (25.4%) of the incidents, this means the numbers for across racial groups are likely higher than reported.

# Comparing to the United States  

The death rate in the United States is 4.2 times higher than in Canada.  On the whole, police in the United States are more violent than police in Canada.

# Racial Disparities

The census data for each country use different demographic groupings so we can't directly compare between all groups.  Three demographic groups: White, Black, and Indigenous are recorded by each.
* Whites are the majority in both countries, while Black and Indigenous people are disproportionately impacted by police killings.  
* The death rates for Indigenous and Black people are much higher than for White people in both Canada and the United States.  The overall rates for each group are higher in the United States.

### However, the disparity between races is actually greater in Canada than the United States.

To show this, we can divide the rates for the three demographic groups by the total rate for each country.  This will tell us how many times more likely a Black or Indigenous individual is to die at the hands of police-involved death than is "typical" for the country.

We can see that Indigenous and Black Canadians respetively are 3.8 and 2.4 times more likely to be victims than the national average.

# Mapping Police-Involved Deaths

### Nunavut has the highest rate of any administrative sub-division in Canada or the United States.

The numbers presented here are contradicted by the [CBC's own reporting](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nunavut-police-related-death-rate-high-data-1.5645619).  This article suggests the death rates may be much higher across the north than presented here.

# A Brief History of Policing in Canada.
Racism has been ingrained in the misson of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) since its foundation.  If you want to learn more about the history of the RCMP, I suggest you listen to these podcasts by [The Secret Life of Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/203-the-secret-life-of-canada/episode/15798131-s3-the-mounties-always-get-their-land-part-1) and [Commons](https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/the-police-2-the-secret-history-of-the-rcmp/).
