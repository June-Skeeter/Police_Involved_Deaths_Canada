# The CBC Dataset is Highly Flawed.

# 1) The CBC has not disclosed the specifics of their methodology.
They have not adequately defined their methods, defined what does and does not qualify as a police killing, or provided sources for their data.

# 2) The Data are not Regularly Updated.
The dataset was initially published in [2018](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform-custom/deadly-force).  It was not updated again for two and a half years.
* The updates coincided with media attention surrounding the Black Lives Matter protests in summer 2020, and to date the CBC has no plans of updating it further.
* This highlights a problem with relying on a news corporation to collect & disseminate this type of information.

# 3) There are many missing/incomplete records.
The victims' race is Unknown in 153 incidents, their names are missing in 45 incidents and the cause of death is Unknown in 22 incidents.

The CBC database has missing incidents entirely, including *at least* four shootings [1](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2014/05/21/jeffrey-reodica-vigil-marks-10-years-since-fatal-police-shooting/) [2](https://globalnews.ca/news/7643929/former-b-c-cop-granted-escorted-temporary-absences/) [3](https://globalnews.ca/news/6267867/asirt-shooting-cochrane-dec-2019/) [4](https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/man-dead-after-police-involved-shooting-in-central-alberta-officials-1.4747826), a death from a [police dog](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/prince-george-death-rcmp-custody-investigation-1.5540688), and two [starlight tours](https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/the-police-4-starlight-tours/).

A starlight tour is a heinous practice where police abduct indigenous individuals and drop them off in rural areas far from home.  When this occurs in the winter, some individuals freeze to death before they can make it home.  I asked the CBC why the starlight tour deaths of Rodney Naistus and Lawrence Wegner in January and February 2000 at the hands of the Saskatoon Police were not included in the database.
* *"While their deaths were very likely a result of starlight tours by the Saskatoon police, they were not added to the database because there is no record of police officers picking them up. The inquests into their deaths were also inconclusive. Because of the lack of definitive proof, it was decided not to include them in the database."*

# Looking to the United States
A non-profit organization, [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/), maintains a database and updates it frequently.
* *We believe the data represented on this site is the most comprehensive accounting of people killed by police since 2013. ... more comprehensive than the Washington Post police shootings database: ... includes additional incidents such as cases where police kill someone through use of a chokehold, baton, taser or other means as well as cases such as killings by off-duty police.*

# Expanding the Dataset and Filling Gaps
The Deadly Force dataset only includes deaths that are "verifiably" the result of police use of force during an arrest.  This does not capture the full picture, we need a broader, more inclusive account of all deaths that are occurring as a result of interactions with the police in Canada. 

### 1) Killings by off duty & ex police officers.
* Domestic violence rates among police families are [two to four](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/police-officers-who-hit-their-wives-or-girlfriends/380329/) times higher than they are in the general public
	* At least three Candian police have been convicted of killing their partners since 2000 [1](https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/10/31/wills_found_guilty_of_murdering_mistress.html) [2](https://globalnews.ca/news/7643929/former-b-c-cop-granted-escorted-temporary-absences/) [3](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ex-rcmp-officer-convicted-of-murder-1.305479)
	

### 2) Deaths resulting from police negligence, incompetence, and prejudcie.  Including those occurring in police custody.
* There are multiple incidents where police have unintentionally killed people with their vehicles [1](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/man-dies-police-custody-puvirnituq-1.4091914) [2](https://barrie.ctvnews.ca/pedestrian-struck-and-killed-by-an-unmarked-opp-vehicle-in-midland-1.5124667?cache=) [3](https://www.bei.gouv.qc.ca/actualites/detail/mise-a-jour-concernant-levenement-survenu-a-mont-laurier-le-13-octobre-lidentite-du-civil-decede.html)
* There are many records of individuals in police custody being denied medical care.
	* In one horrific case, Paul Kayuryuk from [Baker Lake, NU](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/paul-kayuryuk-baker-lake-inquest-1.4231300) died after being found unconscious at the landfill.  Paul was diabetic and had suffered a stroke but the police assumed he was intoxicated and kept him in a jail cell overnight.
* Suicides in police custody are [oftentimes preventable](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/womans-death-in-custody-exposes-indigenous-policing-issues/article32694835/).
* Two men burned to death in a jail cell while being held for public intoxication at the [Kashechewan First Nation police detachment](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kashechewan-fire-inquest-calls-for-more-funds-for-police-stations-training-1.819764).
