# Expanding the Dataset and Filling Gaps

The Deadly Force dataset does not capture the full picture.  We need a broader, more inclusive account of all deaths that are occurring as a result of interactions with police in Canada. 

### 1) Killings by off-duty & ex police officers
* Domestic violence rates among police families are [two to four](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/police-officers-who-hit-their-wives-or-girlfriends/380329/) times higher than they are in the general public.
  * At least four Canadian police have killed their partners since 2000 [1](https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/10/31/wills_found_guilty_of_murdering_mistress.html) [2](https://globalnews.ca/news/7643929/former-b-c-cop-granted-escorted-temporary-absences/) [3](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ex-rcmp-officer-convicted-of-murder-1.305479) [4](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/former-mountie-found-not-criminally-responsible-in-wife-s-death-1.1304062)
  * At least one death from a drunk off-duty officer striking a pedestrian. [1](https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/2019/10/31/killer-cop-justin-holz-gets-30-months-for-killing-cody-severight-in-2017/)
  

### 2) Deaths from Negligence, Incompetence
* There are multiple incidents deaths from police-involved car crashes. [1](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/man-dies-police-custody-puvirnituq-1.4091914) [2](https://barrie.ctvnews.ca/pedestrian-struck-and-killed-by-an-unmarked-opp-vehicle-in-midland-1.5124667?cache=) [3](https://www.bei.gouv.qc.ca/actualites/detail/mise-a-jour-concernant-levenement-survenu-a-mont-laurier-le-13-octobre-lidentite-du-civil-decede.html)
* [Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Regis_Korchinski-Paquet) or suicides during police encounters are a frequent occurence.

### 3) Deaths Occurring in Police Custody
* There are many records of individuals in police custody being denied or delayed medical care.
  * In one horrific case, an Indigenous man from [Baker Lake, NU](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/paul-kayuryuk-baker-lake-inquest-1.4231300) was found unconscious after suffering a stroke.  The police assumed he was intoxicated and kept him in a jail cell overnight.
* Suicides in police custody are [oftentimes preventable](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/womans-death-in-custody-exposes-indigenous-policing-issues/article32694835/).
* Two men burned to death in a jail cell while being held for public intoxication at the [Kashechewan First Nation police detachment](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kashechewan-fire-inquest-calls-for-more-funds-for-police-stations-training-1.819764).


# What Other Information is Available?
[Killercopscanada](https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/) has a more inclusive record of police-involved deaths dating back to July 2015.

# Validating, Updating, and Expanding the Dataset
Using the Deadly Force Dataset, the [Killercopscanada](https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/) blog, and Google Searches, I have stared compiling a new, more comprehensive database of Police-Involved Deaths.
* I have added all verifiable recrods from [Killercopscanada](https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/) occuring after the CBC Deadly Force database ends (June 30, 2020).
* I have begun working backwards through the DeadlyForce database to fill in missing incidients and update missing records.  So far, I have found 53 police-involved-deaths that were left out of the CBC dataset.  
  * I have only just begun this part of the process, there are many more missing records to be added.

There have been *at least* 60 police-involved deaths that have occured since the dataset was published.

# Advocating for Accountability, Attributing Blame

As of 2017 (*2020 update does not include this information*), only 14 officers (3%) had been charged for a killing.  Regardless of whether an officer is charged with a crime, the departments involved are directly responsible for the deaths of these 634 individuals.

# Sharing the Information  

### UBC Library Research Commons GIS Workshops

I have applied these data to create a series of instructional workshops.  The goal is to expose students to this important information and show them how they can use open-source tools to address issues they are passionate about.

Two hands-on workshops show students how they use open source technology to advocate for social justice.  [The first](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/Geospatial-Analysis-Visualization-with-Python/) some basic skills needed to analyze and plot geospatial data with Python.  [The second](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/Geocoding-Web-Mapping-with-Python/) teaches students how to geocode with Python using the Mapbox API and gives them a basic overview of how to create interactive webmaps.
[A third](https://ubc-lib-geo.github.io/Data-Normalization-Classification/) lecture-style workshop highlights the importance of normalizing data and teaches students how to apply different data classification methods.

### Publishing the results

The updated dataset is publicly available on my [github page](https://github.com/June-Spaceboots/Police_Involved_Deaths_Canada/tree/main/Inputs).  I intend to continue working to update, document, and share this dataset.  I have aspirations of bulding an interactive web app to facilitate broader public engagement with the data.
* It is also important to publish this work in a peer reviewed jornal.  But I am unsure what would be an appropriate outlet?
* If anyone has any questions, comments, or interest in collaborating on this please contact me!
