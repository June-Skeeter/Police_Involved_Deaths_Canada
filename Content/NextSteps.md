# Validating, Updating, and expanding the Dataset
So far, I have found 15 police involved deaths that were left out of the dataset.  
* There are more that need to be added, which I haven't been able to find a source for yet.  
  * ["Between 2010 and July 2020, there have been 13 police-related deaths in Nunav"](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nunavut-police-related-death-rate-high-data-1.5645619)
There have been *at least* 32 police involved deaths since

# Advocating for Accountability

As of 2017 (The 2020 update didn't include this information), only 14 officers (3%) had been charged for a killing.

# Attributing Blame

Regardless of whether an officer is charged with a crime, the departments involved are directly responsible for the deaths of these 603 individuals.

# Sharing the Data

This information needs to be disseminated more widely, Systemic Racism is swept under the rug too often in Canada.  The updated dataset is publicly available on my [github page].(https://github.com/June-Spaceboots/Police_Involved_Deaths_Canada/tree/main/Inputs).  I intend to continue to working update, document and share this dataste, but I am just one grad student with limited time & resources.  

If any one has any questions, concenrs, comments, or is interested in collaborating on this please contact reach out me at skeeter1@mail.ubc.ca
