<p>On Friday, April 21, 2017 ASIRT announced that no officers from the Tsuut&#8217;ina Nation Police Service (TNPS) would be charged after a 25-year-old man in police custody apparently killed himself. This despite the fact that the ASIRT investigation found that the force did not follow the “specific protocols [which] were in place” for times when the man, who was known by police, was taken into police custody. According to the ASIRT ruling said “procedural errors” were made and the man was left unsupervised, which protocol said he should not have been “resulting in a sufficient amount of time to commit suicide” (ASIRT).</p>
<p>The man had been arrested on February 17, 2015, supposedly for intoxication and a complaint about his presence at a residence. So once again police were called to address a health care issue and the result is a civilian death.</p>
<p>ASIRT, which has an apparent habit of offering bogus excuses for officers and forces involved in civilian deaths, such as the dubious “excited delirium” claim, this time went one better. Their report attributed the man’s death to the vague and rather unscientific explanation of a “perfect storm” resulting in the man’s death. Surely this is clearly an ideological or copaganda mystification that excuses the officers involved for their own active choices and actions, the committing of procedural errors, and the role those played in contributing to the death. Yet the “perfect storm” means even a consideration of something like negligence is nullified. To the benefit of the police officers responsible.</p>
<p>ASIRT said in a statement that: “This case, however, should remind officers of the duty of care they undertake when exercising custody or control of another person” (ASIRT). Yet there is no mechanism to go beyond the occasional reminder when the investigative body keeps providing excuses to get cops off when civilians die in their custody.</p>
<p>Similarly,  in a statement, Chief Keith Blake of the TNPS said: “The Tsuut’ina Police remain absolutely committed to the highest levels of care for those persons in our care and custody” (Statement). Yet this case shows the lack of commitment to even basic standards of their own protocol. So one might well ask what it is they remain committed too.</p>

It has been used by police forces as a way to simultaneously blame victims for their own killings and give killer cops an answer where no real answer exists.</p>
<p>This dubious piece of copaganda has been offered up once again in Alberta to excuse Edmonton Police Service officers who killed a 25-year-old man on April 29, 2015. This despite well established debunking of the notion of excited delirium. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) offered the excited delirium defense in findings released on April 18, 2017, two years after the young victim died after being subjected to force by multiple officers while in police custody.</p>
<p>Sadly, the victim was targeted by police for the trivial act of supposedly trespassing in the City Centre Mall after nervous security staff called them. The security staff had tweaked to him because they suspected him of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. So an effort at moral regulation by private security ultimately resulted in a young man having his life taken by police. The ASIRT report added to the moral regulatory approach by suggesting the man had been uncooperative with police, saying he refused to follow directions.</p>
<p>For many police officers refusing to follow directions is an invitation to a beating or worse an extrajudicial execution. In this case ASIRT reports that at least four officers used force on the man supposedly to get him into restraints. After being violently removed from the mall and taken into Downtown Division the man was placed on the floor in the detention area. At this point Edmonton Police Services officers noticed he was unconscious, and in medical distress. Paramedics took the man to hospital but he could not be stabilized and was declared dead there.</p>
<p>Notably, the ASIRT reports makes clear that the man was acting in a way that suggested both to private security and police that his issue was health related not criminal. According to the ASIRT release the man “exhibited bizarre behaviour” (ASIRT). The report continues: “He was observed twisting and attempting to pull away. He was observed to be breathing heavily, mumbling and yelling, mostly incoherently” (ASIRT). Yet the intervention was, once again, repressive violence and thuggish force rather than health care.</p>
<p>This is a case in which private security and police intervene against someone who is, at most, dealing with substance abuse issues. Police should not be intervening in this situation. Yet they do so with force. And when force becomes lethal they turn to “excited delirium” in an attempt to justify the unjustifiable. And it routinely gets them off. And mainstream media repeat the claim uncritically.</p>

Only a few blocks later, Edmonton police officers found the man unresponsive and not breathing.An autopsy later determined that the man died as a result of cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Toxicology results found there to be no alcohol, illegal drugs, or prescription medications in his bloodstream denying police some version of the “excited delirium” excuse. It turns out they did not need it.</p>

<p>According to the SIU, the officer, who has not been named publicly, saw a vehicle, a Hyundai, allegedly speeding  on County Road 17 and turned around to follow it. With the police pursuit the vehicle turned down a dirt road into trees, killing the 18-year-old male driver. A 16-year-old girl who was a passenger in the front seat was not seriously injured. The SIU report suggests that the speeding car was going 100 km on a stretch of road with speed limits varying between 50 km/h or 80 km/h when the officer saw it, and around 170 km/h when it left the road.</p>
<p>SIU director Tony Loparco, who has rather consistently sided with police officers and forces in cases of harm to civilian since assuming his position, did raise concerns about the officer&#8217;s speed, reporting that  the OPP vehicle reached 165 km/h, and about the fact that the officer did not immediately notify the dispatcher of the pursuit. According to Loparco, each of these may have constituted a breach of the Ontario Police Services Act.</p>
<p>Yet Loparco decided that the officer’s actions did not meet the bar either for dangerous driving or criminal negligence. In his words: “There is no evidence that the [officer’s] driving created a danger to other users of the roadway or that at any time he interfered with other traffic; additionally the environmental conditions were good and the roads were dry.”</p>
<p>This is a curious statement given that the teen driver was driving at speeds less than the officer reached at the time the officer began pursuit. So if even the officer’s higher speed and the road conditions did not pose a threat to the public, why pursue a joy riding teen driving at lower speeds under the same conditions?</p>
<p>Loparco went further, suggesting that there was no causal connection between the officer’s pursuit and the crash. In his words: “I am unable to establish that there was a causal connection between [the officer’s] actions&#8230;and the single-vehicle collision that caused the&#8230;death.” Yet the stated evidence appears to suggest the teen both sped up and turned off the road in response to the officer’s pursuit and the closing speed of that pursuit.</p>
<p>The SIU assigned eight investigators to the case. Once again it appears the state has protected the state.</p>

Yet more and more policing is carried out by private forces, especially security guard services. And like the state policing forces their members kill. Yet private security is largely unregulated in Canada and have much leeway to act in unaccountable and largely unreported ways.</p>
<p>An Edmonton security guard, Sheldon Russell Bentley (35) is currently seeking bail after being charged with manslaughter and robbery for kicking an Edmonton man, Donald Doucette (51), to death and then robbing him.. Doucette, a culinary chef, was found in an alley next to the Lucky 97 grocery store in the afternoon of July 31, 2016. An autopsy showed Doucette died of blunt abdominal trauma.</p>
<p>Doucette had apparently passed out in the alley in before being approached by two security guards, one of whom was Sheldon Bentley. The charges claim Bentley kicked the passed out victim and stole $20 from him. The guards then simply went back to work.</p>
<p>Doucette&#8217;s has been struggling with alcohol for some time, a problem that family members say began in response to the death of his own father. He had been going to Alcoholics Anonymous as well as starting a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. In addition Doucette struggled with epilepsy. His family often worried that that he would fall down and have a seizure in a non-supportive environment.</p>
<p>Security guards exist only to protect private property and profits. They have no special mandate to act in public space.</p>
<p>As a range of private security forces take over urban space (from security guards to business association “ambassadors”) more attention must be given to them. And their actions must be increasingly observed and challenged. Some have taken to Cop Watch like counter-patrols of security guards and private security.</p>

This includes not even reporting those harms.</p>
<p>In September of 2016 a Hamilton police officer was involved in a vehicular pursuit that killed 20-year-old motorcyclist Chokha Bayez. Yet the Hamilton police broke the law and never reported the killing by the officer to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) as they are required to do. Every police service in Ontario is legally mandated to notify the SIU immediately of any incidents of serious injury, allegations of sexual assault, or death involving their officers (Carter 2017).</p>
<p>An SIU investigation into the Hamilton police killing of Bayez was only initiated when the victim’s family contacted the unit a month after the crash. This is an unacceptable delay that further serves to interfere with any proper investigation. As judge Michael Tulloch put it is his report on oversight in Ontario: ”In most cases, the SIU depends on the police notifying it of incidents within its mandate. Prompt, thorough police notification is the starting point for effective, efficient SIU investigations. If the police take too long to notify the SIU of an incident, or fail to do so at all, any investigation may be compromised and justice may not ever be done” (quoted in Carter 2017).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the investigation is not even listed on a Hamilton police report of SIU investigations presented to the police board earlier in April 2017 (Carter 2017). Constable Steve Welton told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) that the incident was included (despite saying he could not comment on the case and failure to report to the SIU). Oddly, according to the CBC, no vehicular death can be found in the police board report (Carter 2017). CBC News only became aware of the SIU investigation as a result of a freedom of information request listing all of the SIU&#8217;s investigations into Hamilton police officers from 2016 (Carter 2017).</p>
<p>As we have documented consistently in this project there is no proper independent oversight of police and no mechanism is used, legal or otherwise, to ensure there are any negative consequences for officers and police forces who fail to comply with investigative policy and requirements. Even where they violate or flaunt the law.</p>
<p>SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon told CBC News: “If the SIU Director is of the view that there may have been a breach of the regulation, and no charges are laid, it has been the Director&#8217;s practice to notify the Chief/Commissioner of his concerns in order that they may be reviewed” (quoted in Carter 2017). Of course the chief is under no obligation to act and it is unsure if such notice has even been given in this case.</p>
<p>André Marin, a former Ontario ombudsman and past SIU director, is clear in stating that under current conditions there is nothing to stop police from acting like this whenever they so choose. In his words: “Because there are no consequences, police can be extremely lax. They have proven themselves to be ungovernable” (quoted in Carter 2017).</p>
<p>Marin has a stark assessment of police services boards as well. In his view, while they could push for oversight:  “Police services boards should be vigilant and hold their feet to the fire — but they don’t care either. There is absolutely no excuse for this” (quoted in Carter 2017).</p>
<p>Again, the police are a law unto themselves. And the state always protects the state.</p>

The crash occurred on September 13, 2016. The victim was one of five people, including another woman, two men, one of whom was the driver, and a 17-year-old boy, who were in the silver van that crashed following initiation of police pursuit. The four other occupants of the van are in stable condition in local hospital. The driver of the pickup truck was also in hospital in stable condition.</p>
<p>According to Winnipeg police spokesperson Constable Rob Carver, whose statements have not been independently confirmed: “The incident appears to have started when a general patrol unit in the area observed the vehicle with five individuals in it and decided that there was a reason to initiate a traffic stop. Overhead lights were activated and … the vehicle immediately fled and collided with the half-ton” (quoted in CBC News 2016). Curiously Carver went on to suggest that “[w]hile it is a pursuit by a technical definition, we did not actually apparently pursue the vehicle” (quoted in CBC News 2016). However, a short pursuit is still actually apparently a pursuit nonetheless. And in this case one with fatal consequences. No other details have been released by police or independent witnesses. Police have not revealed why they decided to pursue the vehicle in the first place.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba, which examines all incidents of harm to civilians by on-duty and off-duty officers in Manitoba, is investigating this incident which resulted in the death of the woman passenger. The victim has not yet been named publicly.</p>

One victim who died during some type of struggle with an officer on October 12 has been identified as Russell Spence (31) of Winnipeg. Spence was involved in some sort of altercation with an officer during processing at the remand center. He became unresponsive at the center and was transferred to hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Names of victims have typically not been released by authorities but the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation learned of Spence’s identity on October 26. His family has come forward asking for information about the specific circumstances of his death.</p>
<p>Russell Spence has been described as friendly and harmless. In the words of his older brother Kevin Bittern: “Russell was a friendly giant. All his friends and everyone knew he would not hurt anybody, or start anything. I find this very suspicious about his death” (quoted in Taylor 2016). Bittern does not believe Spence was resisting because of the man’s previous experiences in dealing with police. He is upset that the family has been kept in the dark about the killing of their loved one. The family is seeking legal assistance and attempting to piece together Russell Spence’s last hours outside. They are looking for any witnesses to the police intervention against the victim.</p>

<p>The officer turned on his cruiser’s lights and sirens in a an attempt to stop a Nissan after two men entered it from a house where an assault suspect was believed to be. Notably, the officer did not know one of the men was the suspect. In response to the officer’s actions the driver of the Nissan accelerated to try to get away, drove into an intersection, and collided head-on with a Honda, in which the two seniors were passengers. Investigators on scene later estimated that the Nissan was traveling 131 km/hr in a 50 km/hr zone before the collision.</p>
<p>The 94-year-old became unresponsive at the scene before paramedics arrived and was pronounced dead at hospital. The 71-year-old passenger suffered a broken sternum, a broken bone in her back, and two broken bones in her left hand.</p>
<p>The SIU reports that it was only after the driver was arrested that he realized it was the assault suspect. That raises questions about why the officer undertook the actions taken. As well it might have been assumed that the lights and sirens would provoke a response as the car was leaving a residence and it was not a routine traffic stop. The SIU did conclude that it was the officer’s actions that led to the collision but still decided to let him off.</p>
<p>Said SIU director Tony Loparco in his report: “I find that there is no evidence that the [officer’s] driving created a danger to other users of the roadway.” But clearly his actions did create a danger to others in the roadway as one person was left dead and another badly injured as a result. According to Loparco, the officer “was concerned that might cause a situation dangerous to the public.” Which it obviously did.</p>

The release stated Powder was known to commit offences against people he knew and did not know. He was released on conditions including a curfew from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., refraining from buying, drinking or being in possession of alcohol or drugs and not being able to leave the city of Edmonton without written consent.  He was also not allowed to be in licensed premises or enter into any romantic or sexual relationships without informing his partner of his past convictions.  Neighbours said police were regularly in the area and appeared to be checking on Powder.

Share: Share Reddit Text:                         Chris Herhalt  Chris Herhalt, Web Content Writer, CP24	  @_Herhalt  Published Tuesday, February 23, 2021 5:53AM EST Last Updated Tuesday, February 23, 2021 4:19PM EST  A man is dead after he was shot during a confrontation with police at an apartment building in downtown Toronto early on Tuesday morning.  Paramedics said they were called to a Toronto Community Housing building at 291 George Street, north of Dundas Street East, at 3:50 a.m. for a report of a man with a severe injury to his chest.  He was rushed to hospital in life-threatening condition.  The Special Investigations Unit later said that police were called to building at 3:30 a.m., where they went to the third floor of building and confronted a 45-year-old man.  A source tells CP24 that heavily-armed emergency task force officers were the ones that confronted the man and fired on him.  The SIU says two officers fired at the man.  He was pronounced dead in hospital at 4:17 a.m., the SIU said.  Police said they were in the building as part of a missing person investigation when they learned of the possibility that someone inside may have had a gun.  Interim Toronto police Chief James Ramer told CP24 that officers are “simultaneously conducting a homicide investigation as a result of a person who was reported missing earlier,” regarding what transpired at the building, but he declined to elaborate.  “We were here and there was an interaction and as a result the SIU has invoked their mandate,” Ramer said.  In a news release issued late Tuesday afternoon, police said that officers had attended the building as part of their “inquiries into a missing woman.”  Police said that “investigators now have reason to believe a person has died under suspicious circumstance,” though it is not clear whether that person is the missing woman that police were looking for.  They are asking anyone who may have been in the building or in the area between Friday and Sunday to contact investigators if they heard or saw anything suspicious.  “A body has not yet been located and investigators continue to carry out inquiries to establish the full circumstances,” the news release notes.  The SIU is called to investigate any incident involving police and a member of the public that results in death, serious injury or an allegation of sexual assault.

<p>On March 2, 2021, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) announced that a 43-year-old man died after being tased while in Edmonton Police Service (EPS) custody. ASIRT report that police initially attended a residence on February 23, on a disturbance call. They interacted with a 43-year-old man and left. The next day, at about 12:22 PM, EPS officers and members of the integrated Crisis Team (PACT), a unit made up of both EPS officers and mental health workers with Alberta Health Services (AHS), did a follow-up with the man as a so-called wellness check. Police decided to arrest the man under Mental Health Act provisions. At around 1:27 PM, EPS officers transported the man to the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH).</p>



<p>At about 2:22 PM, EPS officers entered the secure room in which the man had been placed, in order to transfer him to another unit. At some point, a “physical altercation” occurred involving three EPS officers, hospital staff, including three security guards, and the man. During this altercation, one police officer deployed a conducted energy weapon. The man was subdued, and medical personnel administered medication. Soon afterwards, the man became unresponsive and could not be revived.</p>

<p>Almost 24-hours after Calgary Police Service officers shot and killed someone at the Nuvo Hotel, some additional details have been released by the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT). They report that Calgary Police Service officers attended a third-floor room at the Nuvo Hotel in response to a call placed by a woman who sounded distressed and was threatening self-harm. According to ASIRT, a woman appeared in the doorway as police approached the room, then turned and went back inside. They report that she returned and appeared in the doorway again, this time holding something that looked like a handgun.</p>



<p>The ASIRT report continues, curiously given that they claim to have reviewed bodycam footage:</p>



<p>“Further details regarding what the woman may have done with the handgun or what occurred thereafter are being withheld pending additional possible interviews; however, shortly thereafter, two officers discharged their service pistols. The woman was struck and fell back into the room.”</p>

<p>A 60-year-old woman fell to her death in North York during a “wellness check” by Toronto police on May 18, 2021. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) reports that Toronto police attended an apartment building at 5785 Yonge Street, near Finch Avenue, to check on the well-being of a woman. They reportedly went to a unit on the eighth floor and briefly spoke with a woman before she went to her bedroom to retrieve a document. At some point the officers were alerted that someone had fallen from the building and it was determined that the person who fell was the woman the officers were speaking with. She was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>



<p>The SIU has assigned three investigators and one forensic investigator to examine the death. None of the police claims have been confirmed publicly.</p>



<p>Police are not about wellness. Several people have been killed by police during wellness checks. A perhaps surprisingly large number of people have fallen to their deaths during police actions.</p>
