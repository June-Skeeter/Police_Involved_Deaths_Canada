Winnipeg General Strike of May and June 1919 stands as perhaps the signal moment of working class resistance and open class conflict in the industrial Canadian context. It remains a still resonant example of working class militance, organization, resolve, solidarity, and vision. It stands too as an unmistakeable symbol of the violence, repression, and racism at the core of the Canadian state. The Winnipeg General Strike offers a clear reminder of the state connection with and willingness to act in support of capital, and to do so using all means in its monopoly of violence. It also shows the racism of the Canadian state and its willingness to divide and conquer workers on the basis of ethnic background and\/or national origin. Finally it shows the readiness of the state, and its major cultural symbol (the RCMP in its earlier incarnation as the Northwest Mounted Police), to kill. Labor historian Edward Seymour describes the reaction to the strike by government authorities at all levels as simply \u201cvicious\u201d (1976, 19).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Class Rule in Winnipeg<\/p>\n<p>Labor historian David Bercuson suggests that business in Winnipeg was anti-union from the start, with unions viewed as an impediment to the climate in which business and investment could grow and prosper in the emerging industrial center (1975, 1\u20132). While this was certainly true of virtually all other cities, Bercuson argues that what was somewhat unique in Winnipeg was the extent to which the city was run by business associations and the particular costs of trade with national and international markets given the city\u2019s isolation and distance and the associated higher transportation costs compared with say Toronto or Montreal. This great distance from both supply sources and markets impelled an obsession with keeping costs (labor particularly) unsustainably low (Bercuson 1975, 2).<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these factors, Bercuson adds another, more curious one. This, he says, was the history of Social Darwinism prevalent among the ruling elite in Winnipeg. He notes that many of Winnipeg\u2019s industrial and political leaders were <em>nouveaux riches<\/em> who had humble beginnings but had made it rich in the growing boom town. They took their success as a sign of personal strength, even superiority, and saw this as a sign that they were natural, and legitimate, leaders. The self-made man could not sympathize with those who, because of personal weakness, needed to organize collectively with others (Bercuson 1975, 2).<\/p>\n<p>Winnipeg had experienced many, often bitter, strikes in the first decades of the twentieth century. Workers sought recognition of unions and collective agreements while bosses were largely successful in keeping unions out of workplaces. Throughout, local government dominated by businesspeople, invariably sided with employers and owners.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The War Economy and Class Struggle<\/p>\n<p>Economic pressures and political dissatisfaction contributed to growing tensions between labor and management by 1918, the last year of the war. While workers were making the sacrifices of the war, employees did not want to share any of the benefits of economic gains within the war economy.<\/p>\n<p>Bercuson suggests that inflation during the war period played, in his view, the most important part in stoking industrial conflict over the war years and in the period immediately following the end of the war (1975, 4). Inflation meant that those workers outside of the war industries and munitions manufacturing especially who could not achieve significant wage gains were faced with declining standards of living and rising costs (Bercuson 1975, 4). In Winnipeg, few workers worked in the arms industries so most were faced with declining living standards throughout the war years and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, labor shortages among skilled workers in particular meant that conditions for union organizing were favorable. This was also fueled by general anger among workers over conscription, the compulsory military service program initiated by Prime Minister Robert Borden in 1917. Indeed the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada (TLC) came to advocate a national general strike against conscription in 1917 (Bercuson 1975, 5). While the planned general strike did not come off, it planted the notion of the tactic of mass opposition to government and capital in the general intellect of workers across the country.<\/p>\n<p>This was a period before full legal standing and recognition for unions and employers could routinely seek and receive court injunctions against picketing during strikes. This allowed bosses to bring in scabs and continue production contributing mightily to the regular defeat of strikes. In Winnipeg in 1917 alone, three strikes had been defeated in this very manner (Bercuson 1975, 6).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The 1918 \u201cGeneral Strike\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In April 1918, strikes of three unions of civic employees generated discussions of sympathy strikes of all civic workers (Bercuson 1975, 6).\u00a0 When the unions reached a tentative agreement with a committee including the mayor and members of council, the city council, through Alderman F.O. Fowler sought to add an amendment that city employees take a no strike pledge for the future. The \u201cFowler Amendment\u201d looked to take away city workers\u2019 right to strike and was supported by the Winnipeg Board of Trade and the <em>Free Press<\/em>. It was vehemently opposed by the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Council (Bercuson 1975, 6).<\/p>\n<p>In response to the Fowler Amendment, city firefighters stopped work the very next day. Ten days later, 13 trades, amounting to 7000 workers, had joined in the work stoppage. Water, fire, light and power, telephone, railway maintenance, and public transportation were impacted (Bercuson 1975, 7).<\/p>\n<p>The Board of Trade futilely tried to keep operations running by supplying scabs. Desperate, and facing growing momentum for workers and a rising movement the city government turned to a new private grouping to negotiate with the unions. This Citizens\u2019 Committee of One Hundred came to an agreement with the workers that was almost the same as the initial one of May 13, 1918. This new agreement was accepted by a somewhat chastened city council and the strike ended on May 24. According to Bercuson the \u201cworkers\u2019 victory was almost complete\u201d (1975, 7).<\/p>\n<p>The conclusions of this 1918 general strike were unmistakeable. The general strike had won the day in a context in which unions acting alone were always losing. It was only this combined and coordinated power that had allowed the workers to win, let alone to win so convincingly. It was well recognized that each union acting on its own would have been defeated (Bercuson 1975, 7). Another outcome was to radicalize workers who now saw greater possibilities for gains and were not as willing to accept less. The employers had the government and courts on their side and could use them. Yet workers united in a general strike could defeat even that combined force of elites.<\/p>\n<p>This was further reinforced when a hoped for general strike in support of the Metal Trades Council in July of 1918 did not materialize and the metal workers were defeated. And this even as the Metal Trades Council had achieved a combination of unions in the industry. The civic workers had gained support of workers in <em>all industries<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>In recognition of this fact, in December 1918 the Trades ad Labour Council passed a motion that gave it the power to call out on strike every union member in the city based on a straight majority of all the city\u2019s union members (Bercuson 1975, 8). This mechanism would come into effect only a few months later.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A Radical Period and the Rise of the One Big Union<\/p>\n<p>The end of the war brought new and renewed hopes that the sacrifices made by so many would be rewarded with a new social foundation of justice and improved social equality. Yet the hopes of most were soon dashed by governments that sought a return to the pre-war status quo. This led to growing discontent and resentment. Not only among industrial workers but among a cross section of Canadian residents, including returning veterans who felt cheated and lied to.<\/p>\n<p>Another factor of inestimable significance in this context was the revolutionary wave sweeping Europe in the post-war period. Revolutions in Russia in 1917 and Germany and Hungary in 1918 suggested that real social change was no pipe dream and could be had for those willing to fight for it. There was no need simply to wait or be patient. Waiting was now seen as a chump\u2019s game, a boss\u2019s dream.<\/p>\n<p>At a Western Labour Conference held in Calgary on March 16, 1919, participants moved for secession from the conservative, craft dominated TLC. They called for a new national labor body organized on industrial lines, rather than by each craft within an industry. The new grouping would be called the OBU, the One Big Union. In structure and approach it resembled syndicalist organizing as in the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The OBU was an explicitly radical formation, not anarchist, supportive of the Bolshevik revolution and influenced by Marxism.<\/p>\n<p>They sought a referendum to see if Canadian workers supported a national general strike beginning on June 1 in demand of the 30 hour work week (Bercuson 1975, 12). The OBU was formally launched during the first week of June at a founding convention in Calgary. At that point the Winnipeg General Strike was into its third week. The OBU provided the nightmare figure for government and employers in Winnipeg even though it had played no direct part in the strike to that point.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Winnipeg General Strike<\/p>\n<p>The Winnipeg General Strike was founded in conflicts in the metal and building trades during April and May of 1919. Lack of progress in making gains in wages, for the buildings trades, and union recognition, for the metals trade, led to a call for a general strike vote under the Trades Council motion of December 1918. Facing a stalemate the Building Trades Council called for a strike of their members for May 1, Mayday, 1919.<\/p>\n<p>The Metal Trades Council, a grouping of craft unions representing workers in contract shops, auto repair, etc. had waged and lost nasty strikes in 1906, 1917, and 1918 (Bercuson 1975, 14). In 1919 they again pressed their attempt for higher wages and the 44 hour work week but were rebuffed by contract shop owners who felt every reason to be confident they could win against yet another union effort. The contractors had benefitted from use of injunctions and had deployed professional strikebreaking firms against the metal workers in the past (Bercuson 1975, 14). The recalcitrant metal works companies were Darwin Bridge, Vulcan Ironworks, and the Manitoba Bridge Company. The MTC sought a nine hour work day and full recognition for unions. On May 2, 1919, the metal workers responded to employers\u2019 intransigence, especially that of the big employers, with a third strike in three years. They sought a shorter work week, wage parity with workers in the railway shops, and union recognition (Bercuson 1975, 15).<\/p>\n<p>At this point the broader union movement in the city was ready for action in defense of their interests. Three trades were on or facing strike action. Others had recently concluded nasty negotiations and were left angered by the process. During the weekly Trade Council meeting of May 6, it was reported that a visiting worker of German origin, attending metal trades shops on behalf of his local, had been arrested. Upon release he spoke to the meeting of government backing employers (Bercuson 1975, 16). The Trades Council meeting decided to poll every union member in the city on their support for a general strike with a decision to be taken at the meeting of May 13. The results of the voting would show more than 11,000 workers in support of the general strike while only a tiny number of 500 were opposed (Bercuson 1975, 17). Thursday, May 15 at 11 AM was decided upon as the start time for the strike.<\/p>\n<p>A Strike Committee was formed that would include three delegates from each of the unions represented on the Trades Council. They would act as the representative body for future negotiations during the strike.<\/p>\n<p>The situation in the metal trades was dire as employers refused even the slightest hint of compromise. Efforts by Premier Tobias Norris and Mayor Charles Frederick Gray to avoid the strike were unsuccessful. A last ditch effort of May 14 by Gray, Norris, and the provincial attorney-general also failed.<\/p>\n<p>At 11 AM on May 15, 1919, Winnipeg was on strike. The response to the call was near total. Within the first day more than 22,000 workers were out on strike (Bercuson 1975, 17\u201318). Participation by workers was unanimous in 94 of 96 unions involved in the strike (Bercuson 1975, 18). As Bercuson illustrates:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFiremen left their stations, telephones were shut down, the city\u2019s electrical workers left turbines and transmission equipment unattended; telegraphers and others responsible for keeping a modern city in touch with the world refused to work. At the waterworks a skeleton staff remained behind at the request of the Trades Council to provide a meagre thirty pounds pressure, sufficient for single-story dwellings. Commercial establishments of every sort, from moving-picture houses to restaurants were closed.\u201d (1975, 18)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In British Columbia 60,000 workers walked out in sympathy strikes. Alberta railway shop workers walked out. Support was also strong in Ontario with 15,000 workers going on strike (Seymour 1976, 19).<\/p>\n<p>To understand the participation of workers requires appreciation of the decades of bitter struggle preceding it and the sense among workers that there was no alternative option. This was a context of open class war and bitter hostility between labor and capital. Yet only one side was ready and prepared to use force.<\/p>\n<p>Most strikers did not see themselves as a revolutionary force. For their part the strike leaders took a cautious approach, refusing even to condone peaceful pickets (Bercuson 1975, 20). To allow for distribution of essentials like milk and food the Strike Committee took the advice of J.W. Carruthers, owner of the Crescent Creamery Company, and issued cards to delivery workers informing the public that those doing bread and milk deliveries were not scabs (Bercuson 1975, 20\u201321). The Strike Committee issued cards stating: \u201cPermitted by authority of Strike Committee\u201d (Bercuson 1975, 21). For local government this was portentous, raising the prospect of workers taking over and managing effectively public services.<\/p>\n<p>The mayor did not want civilians realizing that necessities of life could be provided by a structure outside of the government or its authority. Government did not want to allow the appearance that city administration could be taken over by city workers, who knew how to do the work and did it well, with no need for the government as a middle manager. In an error of strategy the Strike Committee succumbed to a vote of council on May 20 and complied by removing the cards the following day.<\/p>\n<p>Prime Minister Borden, insistent in sending a strong anti-communist message and securing the Canadian state some recognition as a reliable emerging imperialist convoy, would not accept even a settlement that gave the appearance of some success for the striking workers. He would only allow total defeat for the strike or a capitulationist settlement that made clear the workers had been forced to swallow employer demands (Bercuson 1975, 22). Indeed the federal government would play an active and central role in the defeat of the strike. Commissioner A.B. Perry and the Royal North West Mounted Police (RNWMP) would be a major player in those government actions against the strike.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Police Force<\/p>\n<p>Concerned that the regular police were not reliably anti-workers, anti-strike forces led by Brigadier-General H.D.B. Ketchen, commanding officer for the Manitoba military district proposed formation of an alternative force of \u201cspecial police\u201d to replace or add to the regular force (Bercuson 1975, 22). The city at the behest of Ketchen and Citizens\u2019 Committee recruited the special police drawing primarily from anti-strike veterans and middle strata students. The \u201cspecials\u201d were actually paid $6 per day, a wage that was higher than that paid to regular police, showing the hypocrisy and political character of the government and employers alike. It also showed the real lack of concern with legitimacy and the ease with which elites jettison such pretensions when their class interests are up against the wall. When the newly recruited special force was around 2000 members, most of the regular force, nearly 240 officers, was fired. From June 10, Winnipeg was under control pf thousands of men who were openly hostile to the strikers and the strike and who were entirely incompetent and untrained. The specials constituted a gang, a thug force, on city payroll. They immediately set about using physical violence to break up even small public meetings of strikers.<\/p>\n<p>The connection of the police to the military and the engagement in social war by government were unmistakeable. A militia composed largely of volunteers was organized with about 5000 volunteers (Seymour 1976, 17). Ketchen coordinated activities of the NWMP and set up a training program for the newly recruited militia. Former officers were brought in to command the militia. The willingness of the federal government to use lethal force against civilians was clear. Ottawa secretly shipped machine guns to Winnipeg under cover of \u201cregimental baggage\u201d among the freight of the demobilizing 27th Battalion (Bercuson 1975, 23). Ketchen also had an armored vehicle made available for forces in the city. An armored car fitted with three machine guns and holding six sharp shooters was ready and available at Fort Osborne Barracks (Bercuson 1975, 23). The NWMP were issued four machine guns mounted on trucks (Bercuson 1975, 23). They had 60 mounted forces ready for quick deployment. Two mobile militia troops with a motorized machine gun section with two guns apiece, mobilized infantry escorts and a company of motorized infantry were also available (Bercuson 1975, 24). Ketchen had at least 800 troop forces available in addition to the specials and other militia members.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There Are No Neutral\u2019s There: State and Capital United against Workers in Winnipeg<\/p>\n<p>Opposition to the strike consisted of the powerful alliance of employers and government. They were supported by Citizens\u2019 Committee of One Thousand, an anti-union, anti-strike grouping positioned as the voice of \u201cneutral\u201d residents but which was anything but. The Citizens\u2019 Committee was based on the Citizens\u2019 Committee of One Hundred and included members of the Board of Trade, the Manufacturers\u2019 Association, and the Winnipeg bar (Bercuson 1975, 18). Notable members included elites such as H.B. Lyall, an official with Manitoba Bridge and Board of Trade member; A.L. Crossin, a broker with Oldfield, Kirby, and Gardner, an insurance and loan firm, who was also a member of the Board of Trade; J.E. Botterell a senior partner in Baird and Botterell, a grain and stock brokerage, who was also with the Board of Trade; and Isaac Pitblado, a senior partner of the law firm, Pitblado, Hoskin, and Company, that handled the personal business affairs of the federal Minister of the Interior, Arthur Meighen (Bercuson 1975, 18\u201319). \u00a0The Chair of the Committee was A.K. Godfrey, an executive with the Canadian elevator company who was the president of the Board of Trade in 1917 and 1918.<\/p>\n<p>The Committee supported the employers against the workers and provided thousands of volunteers to scab on the strikers (Bercuson 1975, 18). They also waged an ideological battle against the strikers, branding the union leaders as Bolsheviks. In the words of one striker: \u201cThe man who goes out to fight for his master is a brave Briton. The man who comes home to fight for his Mrs. is a bloomin Bolshevik\u201d (quoted in Seymour 1976, 21). With access to secret government conferences they also advised the contract shop owners over the course of the strike (Bercuson 1975, 18).<\/p>\n<p>The Winnipeg General Strike made clear in unquestionable terms the role of the state as an active, forceful supporter of capital rather than a neutral arbitrator. Rather than being disinterested players in disputes, as much criminology and legal studies of the liberal democratic state insist, the state acted in an interested manner on behalf of capital. They actively and consistently took sides. Both the federal and provincial governments immediately intervened on behalf of employers. Striking workers faced the combined efforts and forces of employers and governments. This meant that they faced the legal, political, and military force of the state acting on behalf of the employers they sought to gain concessions from.<\/p>\n<p>Gideon Robertson launched an ideological campaign against the OBU blaming it for trying to foment revolution. He also set a deadline for a forced return to work of post-office workers. Postal workers were ordered back to work under conditions that they sign a pledge not to strike in the future. As the deadline passed the majority of postal workers in Winnipeg were fired and replaced with scab volunteers (Bercuson 1975, 19). The federal government fired 190 postal workers in Winnipeg when they refused to sign the anti-strike pledge. This mechanism of ultimatum and imposed deadline became the preferred means for treating all government employees. It was used against railway mail clerks, provincial telephone employees, firefighters, clerks, and waterworks workers at the city level. Most refused the ultimatums and were fired.<\/p>\n<p>The federal government under Borden was unified in their opposition to the strike and in their commitment to defeat the workers on behalf of capital and the national (bourgeois) interest. They condemned the strike as a revolution. As in other cases like On to Ottawa two decades later the Prime Minister and cabinet expressed a fear that workers would overturn the established (exploitative) order, and pose a real alternative to existing structures of authority. Minister of the Interior, and future Prime Minister, Arthur Meighen saw in Winnipeg the possibility of a single union in Canada with the power to call a single general strike. This was clearly a sign of the immense power of labor if it ever organized jointly and in a united manner.<\/p>\n<p>And working class unity was key. In virtually every lengthy strike there is an attempt by employers and\/or government to split the membership. Often this involves targeting some members as militants and blaming them for intransigence. This often happens through efforts to make a minor offer that might satisfy some conservative demands, gaining some member support, while ignoring or overlooking other significant demands. So-called radicals are then posed as being unreasonable or asking for demands that cannot be granted at the expense of the discomfort of other members who have to endure an unnecessarily long strike.<\/p>\n<p>Four weeks into the general strike Senator Robinson made a move to divide strikers and isolate radicals on the strike committee. On June 16 he secured an agreement from the contract shop employers to recognize craft unions in their workplaces. This did not include recognition of the Metal Trades Council. Robertson published this agreement in the newspapers to move public opinion against the strikers. At the same time the Senator ordered the arrests of Strike Committee radicals under dubious circumstances. Unfortunately moderates on the committee fell into Robertson\u2019s trap and began negotiations to end the strike under the June 16 offer conditions (Bercuson 1975, 25).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Violence of Law: Pernicious Legal Action then and Now<\/p>\n<p>At this point one of the shameful episodes in Canadian state history unfolded. Legislation was introduced in the House of Commons to amend the Immigration Act to allow for the deportation of British subjects not born in Canada. On June 6 the federal government had, in only one hour of discussion, passed amendments to the Immigration Act to allow easier arrest and deportation of so-called \u201cenemy aliens.\u201d In another attempt at divide and conquer the government sought to split workers on the basis of ethnicity, heritage, or national origin. The legislation passed three readings without debate in 20 minutes. It was granted approval by Senate and given Royal Assent in under an hour, which was the quickest passage of legislation in the history of Canadian parliament (Seymour 1976, 20).<\/p>\n<p>Amendments were also made to the Criminal Code section on sedition. The infamous Section 98 was passed which made it a crime to belong to an association that had as a purpose the change of government, industry, or economy through use of force or through advocacy or defense of the use of force (Seymour 1976, 20). Note that this could punish someone simply for defending the use of direct action or armed struggle. The offense was punishable by a maximum sentence of twenty years. One could be imprisoned for up to 20 years simply for printing, importing, distributing, or selling any material that either advocated or defended the use of force (Seymour 1976, 20). The Section 98 was an explicitly anti-communist amendment aimed at criminalizing working class struggle, peoples\u2019 resistance, and anti-capitalism.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone targeted in this way could be subjected to seizure of any property belonging to or even suspected of belonging to such an association. The property could be seized without warrant and forfeited to the Crown if it had simply been shown that a person had attended meeting of such a group, distributed its literature, or spoken publicly in support of it in some way (Seymour 1976, 20). Notably there was a reverse onus in play, counter to legal standards in liberal democracies, such that an accused had to prove they had not acted in defense of such a group rather than, as is regular legal practice, the state carrying the burden of proof.<\/p>\n<p>Significantly, and of great note, these measures are precisely the same as have been restored since 2001 in Liberal and Conservative federal government Anti-Terror Acts. This should be troubling to the contemporary reader.<\/p>\n<p>In the early morning of June 18 several strike leaders and supporters were arrested including some under authority of the newly amended Immigration Act and taken to Stony Mountain penitentiary where they were held while the government worked to deport those it could. The arrested included R.B. Russell, secretary of the MTC, George Armstrong, a streetcar motor person, William Ivens, editor of the Western Labour News and a key spokesperson for labor, A.A. Heaps, a labor representative on Winnipeg Municipal Council, and John Queen, alderperson for Winnipeg\u2019s Ward V (Seymour 1976, 20). The arrests provoked outrage nationally. The MTC in Toronto called for a general strike to release the strike leaders. Miners in Cape Breton wired Ottawa to say: \u201cWe pledge ourselves to do all we can to bring about a general strike all over Canada (quoted in Seymour 1976, 20). Meighen sought their immediate deportation. Others, including A.J. Andrews, were concerned this would turn public opinion against the government and it was decided the men would be released on bail if they agreed to participate no longer in the strike (Bercuson 1975, 25).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Not What They Fought For: Veterans Support the Strike<\/p>\n<p>By this point, however, the flow of events was beyond the grasp of the Strike Committee and other forces were taking center stage. Among them were thousands of World War One veterans who, disillusioned by the lack of improvement in working and social conditions, which they believed they had fought for, after the war, were solidly in support of the strike and its aims. Returned veterans rejected a Citizens\u2019 Committee request to oppose the general strike and the strikers. Quite the contrary, a mass rally of 10,000 ex-soldiers demonstrated at the provincial legislature to demand an immediate settlement to the strike, legislation to protect collective bargaining, and withdrawal of ultimatums to striking public sector workers (Seymour 1976, 19).<\/p>\n<p>As the general strike went on these veterans groupings became more and more vocal and militant (Bercuson 1975, 25). They began organizing lively public demonstrations of support for the general strike. Starting at the end of May they undertook mass parades throughout the streets of downtown Winnipeg, often marching to the legislature, City Hall, or the Headquarters of the Citizens\u2019 Committees (Bercuson 1975, 25). This was an open show of strength, solidarity, and resolve on behalf of the strike and in opposition to the forces of the government, business, and reaction. They also held loud rallies and assemblies in Victoria Park hosting speakers from the Strike Committee and others in support of the Strike (Bercuson 1975, 25).<\/p>\n<p>In response to this reactionary veterans organized counter-demonstrations against the strike. The Mayor came to issue bans on parades on multiple occasions during the strike, bans which more negatively impacted strikers given the size and strength of the pro-strike veterans\u2019 groupings.<\/p>\n<p>In response to the arrests of radical strike leaders and the threats of deportation, and the restarting of street cars, the strike supporting veterans decided on June 20, in a mass rally outside City Hall, to hold a protest the following day.<\/p>\n<p>The next morning, Robertson, Gray, and NWMP Commissioner A.B. Perry met with delegates of the veterans groups to try to avert the demonstration. They could not or would not agree to meet the veterans\u2019 demands of removing the street cars from the streets, settling the strike within four hours, and speaking with the Citizens Committee to convey this (Bercuson 1975, 25). For his part Andrews threatened the veterans with resorting to \u201cother measures\u201d to stop the parade, a clear implication of possible force and violence by police (Bercuson 1975, 26).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Bloody Saturday<\/p>\n<p>As mass crowds gathered across from City Hall in preparation for the march, Acting Police Chief Newton informed Mayor Gray that the force of specials was not prepared to deal with a crowd of that size. Newton agreed with Gray\u2019s assessment that the NWMP be called in and Gray was off to the Mounties\u2019 headquarters to ask Commissioner Perry to intervene. Perry was more than happy to oblige and directed 54 mounted officers and 36 in trucks to take the streets.<\/p>\n<p>By the 2:30 PM parade start time several hundred people had already taken to the streets in an attempt to stop the street cars that had foolishly been driven into the area (which could only be taken as a provocation). Two cars were stopped near City Hall with one taken off its wires and its windows broken<\/p>\n<p>It was at this point that the NWMP arrived on scene and charged the crowd. On multiple runs through the assembled gathering they swung batons on veterans and strikers. The police were met on the second charge with rocks and bottles from the crowd. On a third charge the Mounties brandished cocked revolvers (Bercuson 1975, 27). At 2:35 PM Mayor Gray entered a parapet at City Hall and gave formal reading of the Riot Act. He gave the assembled protesters 30 minutes to leave the streets or face arrests. Before he could even return back inside City Hall he heard the NWMP officers fire into the crowd of civilians.<\/p>\n<p>The order to shoot was given by NWMP Inspector Mead who, perhaps in a moment of panic, had determined to put down the crowd following the second mounted charge. The first shots were fired only moments after Gray had given protesters half an hour to disperse and the shooting by police continued over a terrifying period of several minutes<\/p>\n<p>In the volleys of shots striker Mike Sokowolski was killed instantly, shot in the heart. On the whole around 100 people were injured in the police assault. Striker Mike Schezerbanowicz, shot in the legs, would later die of gangrene resulting from his injuries as inflicted by police gunfire.<\/p>\n<p>Police and the City tried in the aftermath of the police assault to blame protesters for firing a shot but it has been determined that no shots came from the crowd, the only shots came from police. The RNWMP officer in command provided the following account of the assault: \u201cAbout 120 bullets in all were fired into the crowd of men, women, and children. They were not marching around the streets but standing in front of the City Hall. Many were running away when we fired on them\u201d (quoted in Seymour 1976, 20).<\/p>\n<p>Indeed the police claim of initial fire from their targets is a common and ongoing ploy used to justify shooting and killing civilians. It is an excuse that is used falsely in cases right up to the present day. Not a single NWMP officer was hit by any gunfire. Even Inspector Mead acknowledged that he gave the order to fire out of a desperate desire to disperse the crowd, not because he was responding to any shots fired by anyone in the crowd.<\/p>\n<p>As fearful members of the crowd attempted to disperse they were set upon by NWMP officers and specials who took advantage of the situation to brutalize fleeing marchers and take out their animosity toward strikers and the strike. As if this were not enough the state piled on further. General Ketchen released the militia who arrived in the city\u2019s downtown within minutes thanks to auxiliary transport provided by the Citizens\u2019 Committee (Bercuson 1975, 27). The militia brought the militarized machine gun section supported by cavalry. More than 80 marchers were trapped by police and arrested.<\/p>\n<p>By evening the NWMP, militia, and specials had secured several blocks of the downtown area and kept the scene clear until the next day.<\/p>\n<p>After Bloody Saturday Winnipeg was placed under military control. Four days after Bloody Saturday the Strike Committee called off the general strike, effective June 26. After six weeks, the largest General Strike in North America at that time, the strikers had gained none of their demands. Thousands of workers were blacklisted after the strike. Union meetings were banned in Winnipeg (Seymour 1976, 21).<\/p>\n<p>The violent alliance of state and capital had proven too much to overcome, even as the strikers could have won the day had capital not been able to rely on the force of the state.<\/p>\n<p>And this is the key lesson. While many talk of the separation of state and market, the capitalist \u201cfree market\u201d or invisible hand of the market, in Canada as elsewhere there has never been a capitalist market without the sustaining power of the armed monopoly of the state. And no such market could even exist without it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Lessons Learned<\/p>\n<p>The failure of the strikers was in failing to move to a dual power situation in which they would maintain and provide essential services on the basis of their control of labor power and knowledge and capacity of the services in question, outside of government or business. Furthermore, they underestimated or misunderstood the role of government, at all levels, in violently buttressing capital and the state\u2019s willingness to deploy lethal force to maintain capitalist social order. The strikers never seriously considered the necessity of armed defense of the strike and left the military field to police alone. This despite the great support they held among veterans.<\/p>\n<p>The Winnipeg General Strike posed a real material alternative to established state capitalist order. This frightened business and government both. Unfortunately the general strike requires that workers, as those who produce and deliver goods and services, assume some of the roles of economic and social service provision. In doing this in a spirit of solidarity rather than social service or charity, they can show a better way of social organizing and justice. They can also build relationships of solidarity with other civilians that social service and charity providers cannot. This is a basis of mutual aid as the organizing principle for social relations.<\/p>\n<p>As David Bercuson suggests: \u201cThe rapid increase of labour\u2019s power in Winnipeg was a shock to the cozy arrangements and alliances that had existed between capital and government for at least four decades\u201d (1975, 29). Unfortunately the strikers failed to understand or assess the role of the state, taking a fatally liberal approach that the state would serve merely as honest brokers or reasonable arbitrators.<\/p>\n<p>As Bercuson notes: \u201cThe leaders of the strike urged their followers to hold to a non-violent course so they could avoid open confrontation with the government and its police and military forces. They did not realize that this confrontation actually began at eleven A.M. the morning of May 15\u201d (1975, 29). This was social war but it was only being waged fully by one side, that of capital and its allies in state.<\/p>\n<p>Historian Irving Abella suggests that decades of trauma for the labor movement in Canada followed from the suppression of the Winnipeg General Strike (1975, xii). While the movement had high hopes and solid prospects prior to Winnipeg, the actions of the state and capital left the movement in disarray and started a process of declin<\/p>\n<p>While union membership union membership and organization had expanded quickly during the war, after the state violence in Winnipeg, membership declined dramatically throughout the 1920s with organizations paralyzed and leadership divided against itself (Abella 1975, xii). This decline would not be reversed until the years of the Second World War when labor again made significant gains. And the decline was impelled by the force of the state and the use of police to attack, and kill, working people simply organizing to improve their lives.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>References<\/p>\n<p>Abella, Irving. 1975. \u201cIntroduction.\u201d In <em>On Strike: Six Key Labour Struggles in Canada 1919\u20131949<\/em>, Irving Abella (ed.).

The March 20, 2012 killing occurred after Taqqaugaq called into a local radio station and engaged in something of a wordy rant. For some reason a listener decided to call the RCMP about the man. RCMP encountered the victim at his home and killed him.<\/p>\n<p>On Tuesday, November 1, 2016 a coroner\u2019s inquest into the killing of Taqqaugaq by police began. Nunavut Chief Coroner Padma Suramala will carry out the inquest, which will run until November 11.

ten months into 2016 and there have already been four death associated with the Winnipeg Remand Centre. One victim who died during some type of struggle with an officer on October 12 has been identified as Russell Spence (31) of Winnipeg. Spence was involved in some sort of altercation with an officer during processing at the remand center. He became unresponsive at the center and was transferred to hospital where he was pronounced dead.<\/p>\n<p>Names of victims have typically not been released by authorities but the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation learned of Spence\u2019s identity on October 26. His family has come forward asking for information about the specific circumstances of his death.<\/p>\n<p>Russell Spence has been described as friendly and harmless. In the words of his older brother Kevin Bittern: \u201cRussell was a friendly giant. All his friends and everyone knew he would not hurt anybody, or start anything. I find this very suspicious about his death\u201d (quoted in Taylor 2016). Bittern does not believe Spence was resisting because of the man\u2019s previous experiences in dealing with police. He is upset that the family has been kept in the dark about the killing of their loved one. The family is seeking legal assistance and attempting to piece together Russell Spence\u2019s last hours outside. They are looking for any witnesses to the police intervention against the victim.<\/p>\n<p>The Independent Investigation Unit (IIU), the oversight body that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Manitoba, is investigating the death because the struggle was with either a police officer or a corrections officer. The IIU has not revealed which force the officer belonged to.

Following an investigation by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) the Criminal Justice Branch in BC decided, for reasons that are not yet clear, not to lay charges against the four officers involved in the multiple shootings and killing.

Still the Crown decided not to pursue a case against the officers and little more has been said about the attempt by police to justify the shootings and killing by falsely claiming they were only returning fire.

is rather incredible that by the end of 2016 several provinces still do not have distinct agencies to provide some oversight of police in cases in which officers injure or kill civilians. Added to this absurdity is the fact that for those institutions that do exist in various provinces, like the Independent Investigations Office in British Columbia, serious questions about the nature of their independence from police exist.<\/p>\n<p>Qu\u00e9bec had long been among the provinces with no oversight agency, The newly formed Bureau des enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendantes (BEI), which investigates serious cases of harm to civilians, including fatalities, involving police, only began its operations in June 2016. This came as a result of an amendment to the Police Act in May 2013. Prior to the launch of the BEI, investigations into cases of police harm to civilians were carried out by the Public Security Minister and one of three major forces, Montreal, Qu\u00e9bec City, or the provincial S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec (SQ). This clearly reflected a lack of independence, transparency, and accountability and raised issues of conflict of interest and the blue wall of silence. Yet the new agency has not been well received by victims of police violence and\/or their families, critics of police, or community advocates.<\/p>\n<p>One significant advocacy group which has spoken for victims of police violence and their families, and which has focused attention on police violence in the province has spoken publicly in criticism of the BEI. The group Justice for Victims of Police Killings argues that the BEI is lacking in both diversity and independence. They point to, in particular, the police based composition of the agency. In the words of their statement: \u201cWe denounce the creation of the of the \u2018independent\u2019 police investigation bureau that is made up of 14 of 18 ex-police employees, and 11 former police officers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They have called for a meeting with Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Minister of Justice so that victims\u2019 families can raise their concerns and tell their painful stories directly. In support of victims\u2019 families and in order to press for changes to policing, and police oversight, in the province the group held a commemorative vigil in front of the Montreal police association offices on Laurier Street on Saturday, October 22, 2016.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>It is rather incredible that by the end of 2016 several provinces still do not have distinct agencies to provide some oversight of police in cases in which officers injure or kill civilians.

Charges","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/10\/22\/independent-investigations-office-bc-report-on-police-killing-of-hudson-brooks-crown-to-consider-charges\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-5s","content":"<p>After more than a year, a period in which few details have been provided to the public or family, the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia has finished its report into the police killing of 20-year-old Hudson Brooks. The young man was shot and killed by an officer outside the RCMP detachment in South Surrey on July 18, 2015, under mysterious circumstances which have long called for insight and answers. The report has been forwarded to Crown prosecutors for consideration suggesting charges could be laid against an officer or officers involved.<\/p>\n<p>Hudson Brooks was killed while approaching the RCMP detachment in South Surrey. He was intercepted by police on 152 Street in the early morning of July 18, 2015. He was unarmed and wearing shorts and flip-flops when an officer initially targeted him for unknown reasons. Witnesses have suggested Brooks may have been experiencing some distress and seeking assistance at the time. He was shot and killed a short time after the approach by police. Early reports noted that an officer had been shot, in what seemed an attempt to legitimize police actions in the public eye. It has since been revealed that no weapon other than those of police was found on the scene and it is believed the officer\u2019s injury was police inflicted (perhaps even self-inflicted).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Consideration of Charges?<\/p>\n<p>The IIO report has been forwarded to the Crown prosecutors for consideration of charges. This is only done in cases in which the IIO has determined that an officer involved in harm to a civilian may have committed a criminal act. In the words of IIO spokesperson Adan Buckley:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the conclusion of an investigation, if the chief civilian director of the IIO concludes that an officer may have committed any offence, then the chief civilian director will refer the case to crown. If it&#8217;s concluded the officer has not committed any offence, then the chief civilian director will publish a public report.\u201d (quoted in Johnstone 2016)<\/p>\n<p>While there is some relief in the consideration of charges in this case and the possibility that relevant details about the actions of police the night Hudson Brooks was killed by RCMP, there is little to suggest that police will be held accountable in any meaningful way. It is extremely rare in the Canadian state for officers to be charged when they kill civilians, even under the most clearly dubious and egregious circumstances. The state tends to protect its frontline forces. And Crown prosecutors appear reluctant to jeopardize the close relations they have with police on whose efforts their own success and careers partly depend. Over the brief history of the IIO in British Columbia, 56 reports have been forwarded to Crown for consideration of charges. Those 56 reports have resulted in charges only nine times, a tiny fraction of cases. Five cases remain undetermined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJustice for Hudson\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hudson Brooks\u2019 family has worked tirelessly to get answers about the actions of police in killing their loved one. According to his mother Jennifer Brooks: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m shocked because I really, really believed that this would go to Crown. I was just so happy that they closed it, because it was such a long, long wait\u201d (quoted in Johnstone 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Family and friends have organized a movement for \u201cJustice For Hudson\u201d to raise awareness about Hudson\u2019s killing by police and to gain some sense of accountability for the force and officers involved. They have organized several rallies and marches in South Surrey and outside the RCMP detachment where Hudson Brooks was killed. These have been mass events with hundreds of people participating. This is in many ways unique in the Canadian context where ongoing rallies and protests over police killings have been less common and certainly received less media coverage and public attention than has been the case in the United States. This too s changing as a younger generation in particular has mobilized against police violence in the Canadian state.<\/p>\n<p>The Justice for Hudson movement will continue as the case goes forward to the Crown. In the words of Jennifer Brooks: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to wait for six months, seven months or eight months. If we have not heard anything within three months, we will plan another march because we really, really demand justice for Hudson\u201d (quoted in Johnstone 2016).<\/p>\n<p>It remains to be seen if any of the officers involved will be brought to trial. The history in British Columbia and in Canada leaves little cause for optimism<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Johnstone, Jesse. 2016. \u201cPolice Watchdog Sends Hudson Brooks Report to Crown for Charge Consideration.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

police killing civilians experiencing some form of distress has become a terribly regular occurrence. On Tuesday, October 11, 2016, Calgary police shot and killed 76-year-old grandfather Bob Crowle. This was the seventh shooting of a civilian by Calgary police so far in 2016 and resulted in the third fatality. Crowle was killed within moments of police encountering him in the garage of his house in the 100 block of Sunmount Crescent SE. The quick use of lethal force against people in distress is another characteristic of police killings of civilians that has become seemingly routine for officers.<\/p>\n<p>Police were apparently responding to a call from the home at around 11 AM. Upon arrival police found an injured youth on the front lawn of the residence. It would later be revealed that the injured youth was Bob Crowle\u2019s 20-year-old grandson. Police claim they heard noise in the garage and upon entering saw a vehicle with the engine running and a hose attached. Bob Crowle was apparently standing outside the car. Police say an eight-year veteran of the force fired at Crowle when he approached them supposedly holding an \u201cedged\u201d object. The victim was declared dead by paramedics soon thereafter. The grandson was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.<\/p>\n<p>Police accounts do not fit with the experiences of family and friends who knew Bob Crowle. The victim\u2019s sister, Marlene Junck, described the incident as being out of character for her brother. As she knew her brother: \u201cHe was a very gentle man\u201d (quoted in Wood and Lumsden 2016). This is a view repeated by others who knew the man killed by police.<\/p>\n<p>Neighbors have uniformly described Bob Crowle as a nice man. He was regularly seen out in his neighborhood walking his dog. In the words of one neighbor, Barb Warrior, Crowle \u201cWould always stop in and say \u2018Hi\u201d (quoted in Bell 2016). Continued Warrior: \u201cHe had some surgery a few weeks ago and looked to be feeling a little off but he was still out walking his dogs this past week\u201d (quoted in Bell 2016).<\/p>\n<p>According to neighbor Wendy Rudko, Crowle was a \u201cgood person\u201d (Wood and Lumsden 2016). In her view: \u201cJust such a nice man. He was walking in the neighbourhood all the time \u2014 he walked down my back alley a lot \u2014 out walking his dog, multiple times a day\u201d (quoted in Wood and Lumsden 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Another neighbor identified Crowle as the \u201cnicest guy ever\u201d and a calm, easy-going neighbor\u201d who picked and shared apples with neighbors but said he had had a rough time recently when his daughter and her son moved into the home he shared with his wife (quoted in Bell 2016). According to that neighbor: \u201cHe had a rough time with his grandson. I think he was driven to the edge. I think his grandson pushed him to the edge\u201d (quoted in Bell 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the office that examines police harm to civilians in the province is investigating this killing. They do so in an environment in which Calgary police have shot and killed several people during the year. In addition the Calgary force\u2019s chief has issued fairly open threats to police whistleblowers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Bell, David. 2016. \u201c76-Year-Old Man Armed with \u2018Large-Edged Weapon\u2019 Shot by Police.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

the short span\u00a0 of one day, a mere 24 hours, in early October 2016, police in Qu\u00e9bec killed three people who were experiencing some type of mental distress, including at least two where the victims were believed to be suicidal.<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday evening of October 2 the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec (SQ) responded to a phone call apparently from a man in \u00cele-Perrot threatening to kill himself. Upon encountering the man, shortly after arrival on scene, police fired several shots, killing the man.<\/p>\n<p>Later that same night, at about 9:45 PM, the Eeyou Eenou Police in Chirasibi, a Cree community in northern Qu\u00e9bec were dispatched on a call about an 18-year-old youth spotted outside his home apparently with a gun. While officers engaged the man he supposedly shot himself.<\/p>\n<p>Monday night, October 3, SQ in Rouyn-Noranda responded to a call concerning a naked man apparently showing some distress but in front of his own home. Police, for undisclosed reasons, decided to subdue the man using pepper spray, which is well known to cause panic and agitation rather than quiet compliance. The police then moved to the brutal measure of batons. Clearly a curious choice for interacting with a distressed naked person at his own house, posing no threat to the public. The man died during the assault by police due to as yet unreleased causes.<\/p>\n<p>The Bureau des enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendentes du Quebec (BEI), the new agency that examines all cases of police harm to civilians in the province, has deployed 18 investigators to examine the three killings over 24 hours in early October. The bureau has already investigated eight fatal events, police killing civilians, since becoming operational only in June 2016.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Qu\u00e9bec Police Killing People in Distress<\/p>\n<p>A 2015 study led by Annie Gendron, of the \u00c9cole nationale de police du Qu\u00e9bec looked at 143 investigations carried out between 2006 and 2010 involving police harm to civilians at the request of the Qu\u00e9bec Public Security Department. The study found that around 80 percent of cases requiring investigation where police harmed or killed civilians involved victims \u201cin an altered state of consciousness\u201d (Feith 2016). These were said by police to involve either mental health issues or intoxication, which were lumped together, or a combination of both.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the interactions with police were notably of only short duration suggesting little time was taken to communicate, assess needs, or provide some form of care. Police do not engage in dialogue and do not make hospital referrals in enough cases. Often police seem to have a mistaken understanding about the nature of the call according to the Qu\u00e9bec study. And they lack proper training.<\/p>\n<p>To its great discredit the study suggested that one in four of the cases was \u201csuicide by cop\u201d an unsubstantiated, generally dismissed explanation that has no scientific basis and is typically used by police to justify their killings of civilians under dubious circumstances. The fact that someone would reasonably expect police to kill them as an outcome of a call for help and assistance perhaps speaks volumes.<\/p>\n<p>Smaller departments claim not to have enough resources to provide basic mental health training for officers. Police interventions against people in mental health distress has become the neoliberal form of mental health care in Canada as mental health resources and services have been cut at the same time as police budgets are increased.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Feith, Jesse. 2016. \u201cSpate of Fatal Incidents Sparks Investigations by Quebec\u2019s Police-Oversight Bureau.\u201d <em>Montreal Gazette<\/em>.

should not be called to deal with people in personal distress or experiencing mental health issues. This is becoming increasingly clear to many as such situations almost inevitably seem to end with the distressed person being killed by cops conditioned to expect the worst in everyone or trained to act on a \u201ccomply or die\u201d basis in which any affront to their authority is grounds for immediate execution. Police forces across Canada are killing people experiencing distress on a regular basis. And so often they do so in cases where the distressed person is confined to an indoor setting posing no possible threat to the public. And usually no health care support personnel (doctors, nurses, caregivers, counselors, etc.) are involved.<\/p>\n<p>On Thursday, October 6, 2016, S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec (SQ) police officers shot and killed 29-year-old Danny Lafrance-Godmer during a police invasion of a home on Saint Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Street in Montebello, Qu\u00e9bec. Police were apparently responding to a call about a man in distress. They entered the home, eventually going into the attic where they encountered the man identified now as Danny Lafrance-Godmer. It is not clear why, given that police knew Lafrance-Godmer to be in distress and confined to an attic space where he posed no possible threat to the public, the force did not arrange for health care providers to be present to communicate with the man. Instead police engaged the victim immediately and shot him, killing him.<\/p>\n<p>Few details have been released by the bureau des enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendentes du Quebec (BEI), the relatively new agency that investigates cases of injuries or death involving police in the province. The bureau has assigned nine investigators to examine the case but has a curious policy of relying upon other police forces should they determine they need additional support. In this case they have said they will call upon the Montr\u00e9al police. This raises real questions about the independence, autonomy, and, finally, legitimacy of any investigation undertaken under such circumstances.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Police should not be called to deal with people in personal distress or experiencing mental health issues.

police killings of civilians in the United States, Canadian police disproportionately kill people experiencing mental health issues (police in Canada also disproportionately kill Black and Indigenous people). Too often, police insisting on a \u201ccomply or die\u201d framework for encountering civilians quickly act with lethal force against people unwilling or unable to accept orders from officers.<\/p>\n<p>On Friday night, September 30, 2016, police in Hamilton, Ontario shot and killed Anthony (Tony) Divers (36) a man who is reported to have been dealing with mental health issues. According to witnesses the victim had no weapon and posed no threat to police. He was apparently walking away from the Hamilton officers rather than toward them when they killed him.<\/p>\n<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines all cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario is investigating the killing. They have assigned seven investigators and three forensic investigators to review the killing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Police Killing of Tony Divers<\/p>\n<p>Tony Divers was killed around 30 minutes after a 911 call was made about someone possibly hitting a woman. Someone may have reported seeing a gun but neither the police nor the SIU have revealed where that rumor originated and they have not confirmed the presence of any gun on or near the man they killed. A witnesses to the police killing of Tony Divers reports that he did not see the man carrying any gun.<\/p>\n<p>One witness, Joe Towers recalls hering some noise behind him and someone shout \u201cFucking goof\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016). Looking further he noted a police officer following a civilian. What at first seemed like a routine arrest situation quickly turned when Towers heard the officer scream: \u201cGet your fucking hands up\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016b). According to Towers, at this point he noticed that the officer had a gun drawn on the man (Bennett 2016b). Fearing being shot himself by police, Towers attempted to hide behind a trash dumpster when he heard the first shot fired by the cops. In his words: \u201cIt was sort of in mid-turn where I heard the first shot go off, and I was turning back, and I saw the second shot just hit the guy and the guy fell on the ground\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016b). Several police then moved in to arrest the stricken man.<\/p>\n<p>There remain some inconsistencies in the initial police reports. Divers was fatally shot less than 30 minutes after an assault took place that he was believed to have been involved in several blocks away. Police claim that the initial call for the assault came in around 11 PM, but time-stamped security footage from a condominium complex across the street places the initial encounter with the woman occurring at 11:34 PM. The killing of Tony Divers occurred close to midnight. Curiously the man in video footage, not confirmed to be Divers was wearing a \u201csecurity\u201d shirt.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mental Health, Policing, and the Killing of Tony Divers<\/p>\n<p>A Hamilton defense lawyer who has represented Tony Divers since 2011 says that the young man had been struggling with mental health issues in the period before he was killed by police. She suggests he might have been seeking help the night he was killed. According to lawyer Jaime Stephenson: \u201cRecently he\u2019s been dealing with some mental health issues. He\u2019d been intermittently seeking treatment for that\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016b). She notes that the location at which Divers was killed by police might give \u201can indication of where he was headed\u201d at the time, possibly to the psychiatric emergency room at Hamilton\u2019s St. Joseph\u2019s Healthcare (quoted in Bennett 2016b). In her view: \u201cHe was awfully close to St. Joe\u2019s. I wasn\u2019t there, obviously. But my suspicion is that he may have been seeking treatment\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016b). While Stephenson did not know of any specific diagnosis for Divers she was aware that he was receiving \u201csome treatment\u201d for a mental health issue (quoted in Bennett 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>A friend, who would identify himself only as Daniel, remembered Tony Divers as \u201ca very loving and caring brother and friend and there\u2019s nothing he wouldn\u2019t do to help those he cared about\u201d (quoted in Frketich and Moro 2016). The mourning friend expressed the sense of loss:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe is going to be sadly and deeply missed by many whose lives he brightened and affected. I\u2019m personally so deeply heartbroken and lost over this. He was always there for me and carried me through some of my hardest times. Times I\u2019d not have made it through without his love, support, and guidance.\u201d (quoted in Frketich and Moro 2016)<\/p>\n<p>These are the people killed by police who are trained to see not human beings but only threats. And to see them everywhere, in everyone. And often that \u201cthreat\u201d can be as little as refusing to follow orders shouted in anger.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Comply or Die<\/p>\n<p>According to witness Joe Towers, Tony Divers was actually walking away from police when they shot him. This raises again the question of \u201ccomply or die policing\u201d and the killing of a civilian not because they pose a threat but simply because they have ignored or questioned an officer\u2019s authority.<\/p>\n<p>Based on what he saw he did not believe Divers was armed. According to Towers: \u201cI didn\u2019t see him waving any gun around\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016b). This case appears to have been another case of \u201ccomply or die policing,\u201d an all too common occurrence in the Canadian context, based on the witness report. Notably, while suggesting that Divers was not necessarily cooperative, he did not appear to pose a real threat. In Towers\u2019 view: \u201cHe didn\u2019t look very afraid of the cop; he wasn&#8217;t being cooperative, but he didn\u2019t look like he was any particular threat. It just didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to be arrested\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016b). And this is a reasonable enough position for any citizen to take. It should not cost one one\u2019s life. Under conditions of comply or die policing simply not wanting to be arrested, or questioning why one is being engaged by police can be an executable offense.<\/p>\n<p>Witness Joe Towers recalls the officer being close to the victim, in his estimation \u201ca few feet, not very far at all\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016b). In Towers\u2019 view there was no need to use deadly force and given how close the officer was to the victim he believes a taser could have been deployed instead. Hamilton police are among the first police agencies in the province to arm all front line officers with tasers following a 2013 decision by the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services to ease restrictions on who can use them (Bennett 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>Towers was understandably upset by witnessing the police killing of Divers and he questioned why police came at the man with guns drawn at all. Towers stated afterwards: \u201cMy only concern was why the gun was drawn on him in the first place. Perhaps [the cop] was told that he had a gun by somebody else, but I don\u2019t know\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016b). The question has been raised by others concerned about the police killing of Divers. Lawyer Jaime Stephenson questions the police response in this case. In her words: \u201cI query why deadly force was used. Even if there was some report on a 9-1-1 call that there was a weapon, if you\u2019re there and you don\u2019t see a weapon \u2026\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>Another witness, taxi driver Khalid Yousaf, told the Hamilton Spectator Friday night following the shooting that he saw a man, presumably Tony Driver, walking on James Street South and then heard a police officer tell the man to stop walking (Bennett 2016a). Yousaf reported that while the man kept walking the officer followed him again asking him to stop walking. Rather shockingly Yousaf revealed that \u201cthe man turned to face the officer and stretched out his arms at his side and palms facing the officer\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016a). So by his eyewitness account the man killed by police posed no threat and indeed showed the police his open palms, holding nothing. Then, for this, he was shot twice and killed. According to Khalid Yousaf: \u201cThen, he fired\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016a). Yousaf never reported seeing the victim with a gun at any point.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>In reflecting upon the history of police killings of civilians dealing with mental health issues, Stephenson suggests: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like the police are learning from the past mistakes that have happened\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2016b). Sadly police killings in Canada suggest these cases will continue to occur as police insist on pursuing comply or die policing approaches. This is underlined by the fact that because police are never held truly accountable for killing civilians there is no reason for them to change their approach and behavior. And there remains no mechanism for holding them fully accountable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Bennett, Kelly. 2016a. \u201c3 Days after Tony Divers was Shot by Police, Key Questions Remain.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

first decades of the twenty-first century have seen new strategies and tactics of social resistance and activism. Among these have been the largely online actions of groupings like Anonymous, a decentered manifestation of people using online strategies and tactics to confront real world injustices. A global phenomenon Anonymous has inspired and involved activists in the Canadian context as well. While Anonymous is viewed as an online grouping its members live and organize in specific locales where they are active in their communities working on issues of social and environmental justice. And it is in such locales that some have been killed by police and security forces. Such was the case of James McIntyre, a 48 year-old man shot and killed by RCMP, an Anonymous activist who was protesting a destructive BC Hydro megaproject, the Site C Dam. Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, a popular mask worn during protests, McIntyre, who worked as a dishwasher at a local restaurant in Dawson Creek, was claimed by Anonymous as a comrade. In response to McIntyre\u2019s killing the online activists promised actions against the RCMP and the agency\u2019s national website went down on Sunday, July 19.<\/p>\n<p>McIntyre, a M\u00e9tis man, who expressed concern for the land and opposition to destructive development projects was described by his cousin Keith LaRiviere as sharing a deep concern for \u201cthe soil and our ancestral values\u201d (Trumpener 2016a). McIntyre was opposed to the Site C dam project which is understood by Indigenous communities to be an assault on the land as well as a destroyer of culture and a threat to communities. For McIntyre, as for many activists, the project is simply another example of state and business acting in pursuit of shared interests in profit against the health and wellbeing of nature and Indigenous communities. According to LaRiviere, McIntyre was worried impact of the Site C dam on local Indigenous communities and landowners (Trumpener 2016a).<\/p>\n<p>This killing by RCMP occurred in a twenty-first century context in which much concern has been raised about police violence and repression against protesters, particularly those who oppose environmentally harmful projects. Earlier in 2015 the Canadian government passed new legislation giving police institutions increased powers under a rubric of \u201canti-terrorism.\u201d This is also a context of growing mobilization, organizing, and activism against ongoing colonialism and for Indigenous sovereignty and against ecological crisis and climate change.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Killing of James McIntyre<\/p>\n<p>On Thursday, July 15, 2015 RCMP officers in Dawson Creek, B.C. shot and killed a man, later identified as James Daniel McIntyre. McIntyre was killed while standing outside of a local restaurant, the Fixx Urban Grill, where a BC Hydro open house on the contentious Site C dam project was being held. Police were responding to calls about disruptive behavior involving another man but encountered McIntyre instead, shooting him after minimal engagement. The incident was at least partly recorded by a witness, Mike Irmen.<\/p>\n<p>Initial reports suggested James McIntyre was wearing a Guy Fawkes mask at the time he was shot. The Guy Fawkes mask (representing the English rebel involved in a plot to blow up parliament) has become a popular and recognizable symbol of protest, particularly as the public symbol of hacktivist grouping Anonymous. The mask has been adopted by activists since its appearance in the popular film <em>V for Vendetta<\/em> a futuristic, dystopian movie about anti-corporate activism based on the graphic novel of the same title penned by the anarchist Allan Moore. Curiously, McIntyre\u2019s sister, Wanda McIntyre suggested afterward that her brother disliked wearing masks. In her recollection: \u201cHe didn\u2019t really like masks. Maybe that\u2019s one of the reasons he didn&#8217;t pursue his welding (career), just that claustrophobia of having something on your face. I know that he had a mask that I ordered for him [a Phantom of the Opera Halloween costume]. That\u2019s the only mask I knew he had\u201d (quoted in Wakefield 2016). While there has been no formal confirmation, witness accounts suggested the mask was a Guy Fawkes mask and this would fit with McIntyre\u2019s identification with Anonymous.<\/p>\n<p>Before the protest James McIntyre tweeted from his twitter account @jaymack9:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cReady 4 our little showdown? Our people r going 2 b in place at that meeting in Dawson Creek(BC Hydro).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 jay mack (@jaymack9) July 16, 2015<\/p>\n<p>As in other cases, police first gave priority to restraining McIntyre in handcuffs, as he lay dying, rather than offer any medical assistance.<\/p>\n<p>The Independent Investigations Office initially reported, apparently following police, that the man who caused the disturbance at the Site C dam event was McIntyre. Yet it was afterward revealed that McIntyre was not the man who caused the disturbance that apparently led to police being called in the first place. It appears too that police had a mistaken assumption about McIntyre when they encountered him, believing him to be the person who had acted out during the event in the restaurant. This sort of misidentification is a common occurrence in many cases of police causing harm to civilians leading officers to believe someone poses a threat they do not pose and reacting with higher levels of aggression or violence. There is an assumption in such cases that force must be deployed immediately and police act in a prejudicial way in confronting a non-threatening victim.<\/p>\n<p>No further details have been given or clarification offered regarding what threat, if any McIntyre might have posed. For example, it is not clear why, if he posed a threat, no one viewed it as serious enough to point out beforehand or to contact police, while police were contacted simply for someone being loud and apparently wrecking some displays at the meeting. No details have been provided publicly even to clarify how police came to target McIntyre or what led matters to move quickly to a killing by police.<\/p>\n<p>Police claim they took appropriate steps to de-escalate the encounter. Yet witnesses reported hearing only screaming by police and suggested the encounter was fairly brief before police shot the victim.<\/p>\n<p>There has been no independent confirmation that McIntyre carried or displayed an actual knife at the time police encountered him. The IIO did conclude that a knife was at the scene but did not confirm its connection to James McIntyre. Nor has there been any information provided publicly by police or witnesses to suggest that if McIntyre had a knife he used it in a threatening manner toward police or moved in a threatening way toward the officers.<\/p>\n<p>The man who actually disrupted the Site C event later came forward as Terry Hadland, a Peace Valley wheat farmer who has opposed Site C for decades. He reported that he did not know McIntyre and had not even met the young man prior to the event at Fixx Urban Grill. Yet he now feels a debt to the young man killed in a police intervention meant for him. According to Hadland: \u201c(McIntyre) created a diversion so I could get away. He stepped up and took that shot for me, that&#8217;s for sure\u201d (quoted in Wakefield 2016). A terrible and stark realization. And why should anyone be executed by police simply for protesting environmental harm and destruction and in defense of land and communities?<\/p>\n<p>A year after the RCMP killing of James McIntyre and the initiation of the IIO investigation, Terry Hadland says he has never been interviewed by investigators from any service. With disbelief he says: \u201cThey have never gotten ahold of me. No, never\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016b). Hadland finds this particularly strange given that his actions in tearing up maps and tipping tables triggered the call to RCMP that would result in McIntyre\u2019s killing. In Hadland\u2019s account: \u201cI triggered the whole darn thing because I didn\u2019t want Hydro to get away with smooching up to the public\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>After being escorted from the meeting Hadland reported getting in his care and driving directly home. He only heard about the killing the following day. The news hit him hard. In his recollection: \u201cOh, I was devastated. I felt awfully guilty. I could hardly believe that \u2026 it was surreal, especially as I began to realize it was me they were out for\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>The lack of any interview with Hadland was not for his lack of trying to provide one. Upon hearing of the killing of McIntyre Hadland says he immediately rushed over to the Dawson Creek RCMP Detachment and spoke with an officer for around 20 minutes (Trumpener 2016b). In his telling: \u201cI said, \u2018look it, you guys have been duped, because I didn\u2019t do anything down there for you to go down there and shoot somebody\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly the police wanted to hear none of what he had to say. He remembers vividly that the police \u201cpatted me on the back and sent me home\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016b). Police tried to present McIntyre, who had given some cover to Hadland as a threat to him. In classic fear panic language RCMP claimed: \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you were there because maybe this guy was really dangerous. And if you hadn\u2019t been there, and a 911 call made, maybe something else would have happened\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016b). This is a revealing commentary and it shows the \u201cus versus them\u201d view of the world in which everyone is a dangerous threat or a victim that so strictly frames police perspectives and impels their often lethal actions.<\/p>\n<p>Terry Hadland still has no idea why he has been neither charged for his actions that evening nor interviewed despite his efforts to have his account heard. He says: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a word. The investigation, I don\u2019t think it can be thorough until they have spoken to me, and they haven\u2019t\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>The long-time Site C opponent, who describes himself as a technically challenged old farmer says he has had no association with Anonymous and did not know McIntyre. Sadly, he acknowledges: \u201cBut we are now linked forever, he and I\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016).<\/p>\n<p>While still under investigation by the IIO for killing McIntyre, the RCMP undertook a separate investigation of McIntyre. They searched his apartment and seized a variety of personal items. For some reason these included model trains according to Veronica McIntyre. The RCMP E Division did not provide any comment on the status of that investigation in response to inquiries from journalists.<\/p>\n<p>Another Anonymous tweet, from Anarcho Anon, on the Saturday following McIntyre\u2019s killing reported that the apartment at which his family lived was raided by police following the shooting. Police claimed that that raid was unrelated. They offered no explanation about why the raid was carried out so close in time to the killing of James McIntyre or what it involved.<\/p>\n<p>The IIO has refused to identify the officers involved in the shooting. Unlike cases of police killings of civilians in the United States, in the Canadian state context police officers who kill are rarely, if ever, identified publicly. Only in cases in which charges are formally brought by the Crown, which are also extremely rare, will officers be named. This is an issue that critics of police brutality and advocates for greater accountability have long raised.<\/p>\n<p>IIO spokesperson Kellie Kilpatrick has stated that the IIO has not dealt with a case with \u201cas many moving parts and changing landscapes as this one\u201d (quoted in Bein 2015). Kilpatrick suggests that the shooting of James McIntyre is one of the most difficult cases the IIO has ever examined. In her words: \u201cThis is the first time that we\u2019ve had such a significant change in the information we\u2019re reporting\u201d (quoted in Baluja 2015). Yet apart from the facts of misinformation from police about McIntyre\u2019s conduct at the event and the misidentification of another person who was the actual reason police were called to the scene, Kilpatrick has not said why the case is so difficult.<\/p>\n<p>The officer who shot McIntyre was reportedly assigned to administrative duties, returning to active duty after a period of six months. An April 7 letter from the Ministry of Public Safety that appeared in a Dawson Creek city council agenda noted that three officers took off-duty sick leave after the shooting Wakefield 2015). The Dawson City RCMP has a total of 25 members.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A Climate Change Disaster and Threat to Indigenous Communities: Site C<\/p>\n<p>The Site C dam project is a BC Hydro megaproject planned for development in the Peace River Valley in northeastern British Columbia. The proposed 60 meter high mega dam at Site C would flood more than 100 km of the river valley. In addition to the obvious immediate impacts of flooding critics point to the risks of landslides as banks of the reservoir erode with the passage of time. The Site C dam would be the third dam in the valley, added to two existing dams on the Peace River. A major investment for industrial capital the Site C dam project is valued at $8.8 billion.<\/p>\n<p>The Peace River Valley is the home of Treaty 8 First Nations, their hunting, fishing, and trapping grounds. The area is one of the most significant wildlife corridors in the migration corridor from Yellowstone to Yukon (Wilderness Committee n.d.). It is also the site of important old growth boreal forests. The development of the Site C project represents a direct threat, an assault really, on Indigenous communities, cultures, lives, and survival.<\/p>\n<p>The land under threat of flooding is also among the most important agricultural land in northern British Columbia. It is noted for having the only class one soil north of Quesnel (Wilderness Committee n.d.). Many farms will be destroyed if the project goes through. The destruction of such significant agricultural land has raised serious concerns in a period of growing encroachment on agricultural lands. This concern is added to broader concerns about food security particularly for Indigenous communities, and given the destruction of wildlife habitat and food sources on which Indigenous people rely. The project will also submerge valuable carbon sinks (Wilderness Committee n.d.). Mainstream environmentalist David Suzuki has identified the Site C project as a climate change disaster (quoted in Prystupo 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The British Columbia Liberal government claims that it needs the energy provided by Site C to meet provincial needs. Yet this is a political claim. The needs being met are not those of local or provincial residents (regular individual civilians) but rather the desires of multinational capital in the province. In particular the project is about meeting the energy demands of extractives industries, the oil, gas, and mining companies. BC Hydro reports conclude that current demands can be met through energy conservation. Attention can also be given to alternative energy forms. Site C is a public subsidy to the extractives companies. As the Wilderness Committee puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s an $8 billion taxpayer subsidy to a dirty fossil fuel industry that needs cheap energy to expand\u201d (n.d.). Incredibly, the federal\/provincial Joint Review Panel found that not only was the need for the electricity to be generated by the project not clearly demonstrated but the alternatives to the project had not been assessed. Critics suggest that they were not even considered because the interest is not in meeting residential demands but rather is solely concerned with industrial demands of corporations.<\/p>\n<p>Site C was granted environmental assessment approval by the governments of British Columbia and Canada on October 14, 2014. This despite the fact that the Joint Review Panel concluded that Site C would cause irreparable damage to local First Nations communities and fish and wildlife populations (Wilderness Committee n.d.). The BC Liberal government approved construction of the dam on December 16, 2014.<\/p>\n<p>As the prospects of legal challenges from multiple constituencies arose the Premier of British Columbia Christy Clark stated, in anti-democratic fashion, her intention to get construction on the dam \u201cto the point of no return\u201d before a political election in May 2017 could lead to a change in government and possible repeal of the project. BC Hydro has estimated that by the time of the election around $4 billion of construction contracts will be locked in place (Hunter 2016). As of September 2016, construction has moved well along despite opposition.<\/p>\n<p>Scholars and scientists have also raised grave concerns about the Site C project, in terms of environmental impacts and in terms of government obligations to seek and achieve informed consent from Indigenous communities prior to any possible development and to meet Treaty obligations more broadly. In May of 2016 more than 200 high profile Canadian scholars signed a letter expressing their deep concerns about the Site C approval process. The elite Royal Society of Canada wrote a separate letter directly to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calling on the federal government to halt construction on the project. The letter from \u201cConcerned Scientists\u201d outlined their intersecting concerns in the following language: \u201cOur assessment is that this process did not accord with the commitments of both the provincial and federal governments to reconciliation with and legal obligations to First Nations, protection of the environment, and evidence-based decision-making with scientific integrity\u201d (quoted in Cheadle 2016). The federal government rejected the appeal and the Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna announced that the government had \u201cno intention to revisit the Site C environmental assessment\u201d (quoted in McCarthy 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The Treaty 8 First Nations from the Peace River Region are actively and courageously opposing the Site C project. They are defending their communities, cultures, land, and Treaty rights against interests of major multinational capital, local corporations, and provincial and federal governments in Canada. In April of 2016 BC Treaty 8 First Nations filed a legal challenge to the project with the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Both the BC Treaty 8 First Nations and the Peace Valley Landowners\u2019 Association have undertaken legal challenges to the project in the federal court of Canada. BC Hydro attempted to have these cases expedited to allow them to continue on their 2016 construction schedule. The court dismissed their request. Court challenges are also being brought by Alberta Treaty 8 First Nations. The Blueberry River First Nation has brought forward a \u201csweeping challenge\u201d which gets to the heart of Canadian state and Indigenous relations in Canada. Their case cites \u201ca century of broken treaty promises to be able to continue practicing their traditions on the land\u201d (quoted in Gillis 2015).<\/p>\n<p>These are some of the stakes in this important twenty-first century struggle. The battles over Site C raise current issues of colonialism and decolonization, land claims, Indigenous sovereignty, ecological integrity and climate change, and social justice. These are the issues that motivated James McIntyre to oppose the Site C project and to take an active stand in doing so. Inevitably these are the struggles that he put his life on the line for. In the support of government and corporate interests and against Indigenous, social, and ecological justice the RCMP were willing to kill. And did kill.<\/p>\n<p>Keith LaRiviere has continued to act and speak out against the Site C dam since his cousin\u2019s killing. LaRiviere has participated in protest events such as the Paddle for Peace, a canoe demonstration against Site C in 2016. And this matters to him, not only for James but for the land and community. In his view: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a family issue, this is an environmental issue\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016a). And it is an issue that has galvanized broad support in defense of the land and communities and against Site C. Against the community opposition the supporters of Site C are largely the state and capital.<\/p>\n<p>This is a message that James McIntyre was working to get out. The RCMP silenced that particular voice but the message continues as has community organizing against Site C. As LaRiviere suggests: \u201cHe was worried about the Peace country being destroyed by another dirty project. If that\u2019s Jim\u2019s message, don\u2019t stifle his voice\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016a).<\/p>\n<p>In response to the killing of McIntyre, BC Hydro postponed several scheduled job fairs for Site C that were to have been held in northern British Columbia that month. The postponed job fairs were scheduled for the communities of Chetwynd, Fort St. John, and Tumbler Ridge. They also said they would review their policies and procedures around public meetings. In public statement BC Hydro announced: \u201cBC Hydro is currently evaluating its policies and procedures for public meetings. The postponement of the job fairs will give us time to complete this task\u2026Our intent is to ensure the safety of our staff and members of the public\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2015b). This move was viewed by many commentators and opponents of Site C alike really as a measure to keep opponents out and critical voices from being heard.<\/p>\n<p>A moderate environmental group, the Wilderness Committee, also decided to cancel a protest planned for the week McIntyre was killed outside of BC Hydro\u2019s Vancouver offices. This was a strange choice given that McIntyre was killed opposing a project the Wilderness Committee also opposes. A better option might have been to protest at an RCMP detachment in the Metro Vancouver area. That would have honored McIntyre\u2019s commitment and sacrifice.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On Anonymity<\/p>\n<p>Anonymity has become a marker of modern life in industrial capitalist society and the mass politics of liberal democracy. Anonymity is built right into the key structures and institutions of everyday life in modern capitalism. In work, people are anonymous producers playing a part that is often indistinct, general, replaceable, lacking the uniqueness of skilled, artisanal work. This is an aspect of the alienation from labor that Marx so famously addresses.<\/p>\n<p>In politics, mass democracy renders political action, by definition, an anonymous, nameless, unidentifiable, indistinct activity behind a screen at a ballot box every four or five years. The political actor, rendered as a voter, is further made anonymous between elections in the mass regurgitation of incessant, nameless poll results.<\/p>\n<p>In the urbanity of capitalist life, which has now, for the first time in human history, compelled most people on the planet to live in cities, residents live in close proximity to people they do not know, who do not know them, and experience literally thousands of anonymous interactions with people every year, from buying a newspaper, to getting on the bus, to attending a concert, to simply passing in the street.<\/p>\n<p>Anonymity finds perhaps its most idiomatic or iconic moment in time spent online in which people can post intense, intimate feelings or thoughts in forms, such as online comments, twitter, or websites and blogs, which are strictly anonymous.<\/p>\n<p>It is perhaps characteristic of the age and social structure of contemporary capitalism then that activism has taken the form of anonymity and the anonymous. Indeed, perhaps the most striking political formation or manifestation online is quite literally known as Anonymous. This makes sense both because the internet allows for anonymity but is also representative of the surveillance powers of the capitalist state and corporations that seek to destroy anonymity and name and identify anyone who goes against the state capitalist consensus of accumulation, exploitation, and compliance. Anonymity offers the activist the mask of secrecy and privacy that the state is so determined to deny.<\/p>\n<p>Anonymous is the name of a decentered, loose affinity group of online activists and hackers. Their decentered nature means they are largely formless and structureless. As communications scholar and McGill University Professor Gabriella Coleman suggests: \u201cAnonymous is a little bit hard to define, because it\u2019s a collective name that anyone around the world can take\u201d (quoted in Early Edition 2015). \u00a0They share mostly an action orientation and an identity, important narrative practices, and symbolism. It is a banner that can be adopted by diverse users as needs and circumstances arise (Shantz and Tomblin 2014).<\/p>\n<p>By their nature in being an anonymous grouping that seeks privacy and avoidance of security their members are largely unknown, nameless, unidentifiable. Gabriella Coleman suggests that what is known of the demographics of the grouping places most of its members as youth between the ages of 15 and 35. Much of the demographic information known about Anonymous comes from those members who have been arrested. Thus, that information might say more about the people who are caught than about the broader participant group.<\/p>\n<p>Anonymous provided James McIntyre an ideal expression for political action. It reflected his introverted nature and love of privacy. It reflected his preference of being alone, unidentified, rather than being a public figure or socially recognized. Keith LaRiviere identified his cousin\u2019s major characteristics as \u201cisolation and [a] huge brain\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016a). This, it would seem are major characteristics of many who find affinity with, and\/or act on behalf of, Anonymous. For LaRiviere: \u201cMaking a statement with that mask makes all the sense in the world to me for Jim, because he was alone in his life,\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016a).<\/p>\n<p>Anonymous activists approach activism through a mix of new and old tactics from denial of service attacks and hacks to whistleblowing or public shaming. \u00a0Coleman notes that Anonymous was initially known primarily as a prankster grouping gaining notoriety for internet pranks. Since 2008 they have turned to direct action and political campaigns, projects, and interventions. Among the issues they have become known for taking involve state or corporate intrusion on privacy, issues of censorship, opposition to surveillance, and matters of free speech.<\/p>\n<p>With the emergence of Black Lives Matter and movements against police brutality since the police killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, the group has actively supported civilians opposing police violence. Operation Ferguson provided support for protesters speaking out and mobilizing against the racist policing practices of the Ferguson force that killed Michael Brown. They have worked to see the names of officers involved in the killing of civilians released publicly. They have also brought attention on disruptive and interfering police officials and police association representatives who have operated to shield police who kill civilians or who eek to blame the victims. Since Ferguson this work has continued in cases involving police harm to civilians in the United States and Canada.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of activism Anonymous has been most well-known for DDOS, or distributed denial of service, attacks in which overwhelming traffic is directed to a target website causing the server to shut down. The site becomes inaccessible. This is a way to shut down an offending institution\u2019s online venues and potentially cost money, supporters, and\/or sponsors. Anonymous has also publicized confidential documents and publicized information in a form of whistleblowing to the public (Shantz and Tomblin 2014).<\/p>\n<p>More recently the group has turned to doxing. This practice has been used to \u201cout\u201d offending individuals by releasing their names and private information such as phone numbers or home addresses. This particular tactic has been used in cases of police violence to name relevant officers involved. Anonymous usually follows through on its threats in cases like the policing killing of James McIntyre. Although it might be noted that the impact is usually one of publicity or shaming more than severe consequences for government or corporations. As Coleman suggests: \u201cThey don\u2019t usually make a call and then do nothing. Many times they will exaggerate what they will do\u201d (quoted in Early Edition 2015). In Coleman\u2019s assessment, in a case like this the most credible and impactful threat would likely be doxing.<\/p>\n<p>In one particularly significant action against Canadian government and security forces Anonymous took responsibility for shutting down the websites of the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS), the Canadian government\u2019s spy agency, in an appeal for Canadians to oppose Bill C-51 in 2015. C-51 is a repressive piece of legislation that became law as the Anti-Terror Act of 2015. It contains provisions that give CSIS investigative powers, allow for the criminalization of so-called bad thoughts only (rather than terrorist actions), and allows for the criminalization of economic activity such as strikes, boycotts, or blockades. It also extends possibilities for criminalization of protests, particularly those against energy projects. The law also gives police additional powers to arrest people pre-emptively.<\/p>\n<p>While primarily viewed as an online phenomenon, every once in a while we are reminded that any activism also occurs in the real, material world where all activists must live, work, love, and play. This fact is violently reinforced when, as in James McIntyre\u2019s case, an Anonymous member is killed by a security force. After the RCMP killing of James McIntyre, Anonymous claimed that McIntyre was the fourth of its members to be killed by security forces around the world in four years.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>An Anonymous Life<\/p>\n<p>McIntyre\u2019s friends and family described him as a gentle, quiet man who did not interact much with people directly. He was said to be quite intelligent and thoughtful. McIntyre was said to be very close with his family regularly attending family gatherings. He had only moved out and into his own apartment a few years before police killed him. Even then, a devoted son and family member, McIntyre rented his apartment a floor above his mother\u2019s apartment. McIntyre\u2019s mom, Veronica, said he often talked about the Site C project which greatly troubled him.<\/p>\n<p>James McIntyre was raised along with four siblings by Veronica, a single mother. He spent his early years in the Dawson Creek area attending elementary school in Pouce Coupe and Central Middle School in Dawson Creek. The family moved to Grande Prairie, Alberta where McIntyre graduated from St. Joseph Catholic High. Following high school James joined his brothers in the trades, working several years as a welder primarily at mills in northern British Columbia and Alberta. (Wakefield 2016). McIntyre returned to Dawson Creek in 2008. He worked at Chances Casino and Le\u2019s Family Restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>An afficionado of model trains from an early age, McIntyre used the internet to connect with model train enthusiasts from all over. In the words of his sister Wanda McIntyre: \u201cHe was train crazy. His apartment was kind of small so he couldn\u2019t have a big layout. He got a computer I think probably for the train aspect\u201d (quoted in Wakefield 2016). His interest in model trains and use of online media to discuss them may have opened new venues for his broader interests in environment and land.<\/p>\n<p>Unassuming and a dedicated worker, McIntyre had received notice in the local newspapers only once, for winning an employee award for his work as a dishwasher, before his sensational killing by police garnered international media attention. McIntyre worked as a dishwasher at a local restaurant and casino and apparently loved the job as it afforded him time to himself away from the attentions of others.<\/p>\n<p>Family described McIntyre as \u201cstraight edge,\u201d eschewing smokes, drugs, and alcohol. According to his cousin Keith LaRiviere: \u201cHe didn\u2019t go out and play. He didn\u2019t join the baseball team with us. He didn\u2019t drink. He didn\u2019t have a girlfriend. He didn\u2019t drive a car. He wouldn\u2019t cross the road except at a crosswalk. He was soft\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016a). McIntyre was a hard worker who saved his money largely to attend model train conventions, attending events in Prince George, Berkeley, California, and Reno, Nevada (Wakefield 2016). The owner of Le\u2019s Family Restaurant, Le Nguyen described McIntyre as a \u201cnormal guy\u201d (quoted in Wakefield 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Committed to environmental care, McIntyre developed his own recycling program to sort bottles and cans at work in the absence of an employer developed program. McIntyre recycled the materials at Chances Casino taking them to bins outside a Walmart near the casino. According to his sister Wanda McIntyre: &#8220;He was very much an environmentalist, he was always trying to recycle and do stuff like that, but he wasn\u2019t an extremist. I don\u2019t know how he even found out about it, whether he knew someone who was into it and brought him into the fold, I had no idea. He never talked about it to me\u201d (quoted in Wakefield 2016). His mother shared this perspective. She knew her son was concerned about the environment but did not speak with him about how and why he came to be actively concerned about the Site C project specifically. In her recollection: \u201cI don\u2019t know why he got involved with that Site C dam. He was concerned about that. I guess it was just the environment, and he felt for the people there. (That&#8217;s) why he voiced his opinion\u201d (quoted in Wakefield 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Anonymous Responds<\/p>\n<p>Anonymous identified McIntyre as a \u201cfallen comrade.\u201d The response by Anonymous to the police killing of James McIntyre was named \u201cOperation Anon Down\u201d and was designed to achieve \u201cjustice (and vengeance if necessary) for our fallen comrade in Dawson Creek\u201d (Early Edition 2015). They released statements calling for accountability for the officers involved. They tweeted messages directly to the RCMP.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOhai @rcmpgrcpolice we would like to report a murder of one of our comrades by some of your officers. Shall we expect justice or cover up?<\/p>\n<p>7:45 PM &#8211; 17 Jul 2015\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Anonymous statement after the killing of James McIntyre went further:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn their statement, Anonymous also said that \u201can RCMP officer mercilessly shot and killed a masked anon without provocation or cause,\u201d and \u201cif Canadian police were as brave as Canadian nurses they could deal with people with knives without hiding behind bullets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe will most certainly avenge our own,\u201d the group said, adding that they will also fundraise to cover the costs of the burial of their fallen comrade.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf we do not receive justice, rest assured there will be revenge,\u201d they said. \u201cBehind this mask is an idea, and ideas are bullet-proof.\u201d (Bein 2015)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In response to the RCMP killing of James McIntyre, Anonymous called on people to protest at RCMP headquarters in every province. The day after Anonymous released a statement on McIntyre\u2019s killing, the RCMP\u2019s national website was shut down for several hours. RCMP sites in British Columbia and Dawson Creek also crashed on the Sunday following McIntyre\u2019s killing (CBC 2015a).<\/p>\n<p>Then Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said the threats were taken seriously but offered little insight into the government response. In a public statement he offered this platitude on passive democracy: \u201cThere are many ways this country enjoys freedom to express our democratic views. I invite those who want to express their views to use democratic ways. Those who don&#8217;t expose themselves to face the full force of the law\u201d (quoted in Kane 2015). The government said it would leave matters of investigation to the Independent Investigations Office, a strange response since that agency only looks into harms caused to civilians by police. It has no mandate to investigate perceived threats to government websites.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the RCMP did carry out some investigation into social media activities of Anonymous following their threats on the RCMP website. Minister Blaney did note that the government viewed security issues as a priority and dedicated funding to work with capital (private businesses) to target electronic threats. This made clear the role of government in acting as a security service for capital (at working class taxpayer expense). For the government, according to Blaney: \u201cWe are constantly monitoring cyber security and cyberattacks\u201d (quoted in Kane 2015).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion: The Death of Truth<\/p>\n<p>According to Keith LaRiviere: \u201cJim didn\u2019t deserve to die in a brutal manner. The man lying on the ground was not a criminal. He was a victim of police violence\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016a). Wanda McIntrye cannot say what the family would hope to get from any investigation into her brother\u2019s killing. Regardless of the investigation\u2019s outcome, her brother will still be as dead. In her words: \u201cWe\u2019re still in shock. I guess the outcome is what the outcome is, whatever we say or do. It\u2019s not going to change the fact\u201d (quoted in Wakefield 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Dawson Creek Mayor Dale Bumstead appears to share the perspective that this killing did not need to happen. In his words\u201d Somebody lost their life yesterday, senselessly in my view, and I just hate the fact that it happened in my community\u201d (quoted in Baluja 2015). People in British Columbia have long raised questions about the disproportionate use of lethal force by police, RCMP in particular, in small towns and especially small northern towns.<\/p>\n<p>The details of his killing by police, as is typically the case with regard to police killings of civilians in Canada, will likely not come out publicly. As James McIntyre\u2019s cousin Keith LaRiviere is left to conclude: \u201cThe truth is with Jim. The truth is with a dead man\u201d (quoted in Trumpener 2016a). Wanda McIntyre is left with a similar feeling. In her view: \u201cThere\u2019s no answers, and the only person with the answers is gone\u201d (quoted in Wakefield 2016).<\/p>\n<p>While appreciating the sentiment involved, that is not entirely true. RCMP officers involved in the shooting, and certainly those who killed James McIntyre, surely have some answers as to what happened that night in Dawson Creek. But, as is typical in the Canadian context when police kill civilians, the police are not required to provide those answers and there are virtually no mechanisms for a thorough, truthful reporting of events anyway.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Baluja, Tamara. 2015. \u201cDawson Creek Police Shoot Man Who Refused to Throw Away Weapon, Witness Claims.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.
