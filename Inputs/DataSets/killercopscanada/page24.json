This characteristic of vindictiveness comes to the fore powerfully, along with other regulars secretiveness, defensiveness, and self-righteousness in situations where police respond to critics when they have killed someone. This vindictiveness was clearly on display on January 12 in Hamilton, Ontario when police arrested Edward Divers moments after he made a presentation at the Hamilton Police Services Board critical of police actions in the killing of his brother Tony Divers in September of 2016.<\/p>\n<p>This vindictiveness is emphasized by the fact that Edward Divers was arrested on an 11-year-old warrant for a failure to appear. The use of failure to appear charges to criminalize people is a scandal in Canada where it is routinely laid against poor, homeless, and street involved people who may lack resources to ensure appearances at court appointed times or who have irregular schedules. Growing numbers of people are being detained solely on the basis of failure to appear charges. In the Divers case the Crown actively opposed his release but he was finally released on bail.<\/p>\n<p>The family believes they have been specifically targeted by police. And any observer might well ask why and under what circumstances the police investigated Divers and came across the decade-old warrant. A reasonable conclusion is that they went searching for anything on Edward Divers knowing of his criticisms of police and intention to present at the Police Board meeting.<\/p>\n<p>Divers has been living with sisters in Hamilton since October 2016, shortly after his brother\u2019s killing. Despite this he was not arrested until he came forward to criticize police and made application to speak at the Police Board. Divers criticism ahs extended to the chief who he has suggested acts more like a politician than a human in addressing police use of lethal force.<\/p>\n<p>Police Board member Councillor Terry Whitehead, justified police by saying blandly: \u201cThey have a responsibility to protect the public\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2017). Yet it is not clear how the public is in need of protection for a failure to appear.<\/p>\n<p>Divers\u2019 sister, Yvonne Alexander described the operations police put in place to apprehend the failure to appear suspect. In her words: \u201cThey had police at every exit unbeknownst to us during the meeting. Then as soon as we walked over the threshold out of city hall, five cops arrested him. They wouldn\u2019t tell us why\u201d (quoted in Bennett 2017).<\/p>\n<p>We can surmise that it had everything to do with a grieving brother simply daring to question a force that has killed his brother. And which is used to acting vindictively, viciously, with impunity. They do it because they can.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Bennett, Kelly. 2017. \u201cGrieving Brother Criticizes Police, Gets Arrested on 11-Year-Old Warrant.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

\u201cMonty\u201d Robinson the RCMP officer who has killed two people, most infamously Robert Dziekanski on October 14, 2007, has lost the appeal of his conviction for perjury in that case. The panel of Appeal Court judges in British Columbia upheld a lower court\u2019s decision that found Robinson lied during a public inquiry into the circumstances leading to the death of Robert Dziekanski. In the majority decision Justice Mary Newbury wrote:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe judge\u2019s findings cannot in my view be said to have been unreasonable. I have little doubt that \u2018viewed through the lens of judicial experience,\u2019 the appellant had a \u2018clear reason and motive to deny\u2019 that he and his colleagues had discussed the incident and colluded in their evidence before the inquiry. The court was not left with any reasonable doubt on this point.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Robinson had been sentenced to two years less a day for perjury in that case.<\/p>\n<p>The Dziekanski killing gained international attention and shone a light on practices of public deception and lying in the RCMP. Robinson was the senior of four officers who confronted 40-year-old Robert Dziekanski in the Vancouver International Airport where the Polish traveller who spoke no English had been left without support for almost 10 hours in the arrivals terminal. RCMP almost immediately upon encountering Dziekanski used a taser on the man multiple times before pinning him to the ground causing his death on the scene. RCMP public spokespeople initially said Dziekanski had been irate and aggressive during the encounter and suggested he was drunk. The phony \u201cexcited delirium\u201d claim was even suggested. Until the civilian video surfaced showing that in fact Dziekanski was compliant with officers, did not threaten them, and was in fact moving in the direction they suggested. The RCMP had clearly lied to the public in an effort to frame Dziekanski for his own death (a common endeavor in police killings).<\/p>\n<p>The public display of deception by RCMP prompted the inquiry at which Robinson and fellow officer Kwesi Millington were found to have perjured themselves by colluding and then lying on testimony. Millington lost his appeal in a unanimous decision in July 2016.<\/p>\n<p>Robinson would go on to kill 21-year-old Orion Hutchinson hitting the young motorcyclist with his SUV on October 28, 2008. His two children were in the vehicle at the time. In that case Robinson was convicted of obstruction of justice. It was found that the Mountie had used his police training to avoid charges of impaired driving by claiming that after the crash he went home and drank two shots of vodka to \u201ccalm his nerves\u201d (a police ploy to cover drinking before the crash). The court heard that he had bragged to party guests that his training gave him a way to deal with drunk driving charges. Robinson was given a conditional sentence of 12 months in that case.<\/p>\n<p>The fact remains that RCMP officer Monty Robinson killed two civilians. He has not been charged or held accountable for those killings.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Benjamin \u201cMonty\u201d Robinson the RCMP officer who has killed two people, most infamously Robert Dziekanski on October 14, 2007, has lost the appeal of his conviction for perjury in that case.

Cloutier Identified as Man Killed by Montreal Police at Old Brewery Mission, January 6, 2017","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2017\/01\/12\/jimmy-cloutier-identified-as-man-killed-by-montreal-police-at-old-brewery-mission-january-6-2017\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-7r","content":"<p>The 38-year-old man shot and killed by Montreal Police on Friday, January 6, 2017, has been identified as Jimmy Cloutier, a homeless man who made use of shelter services at the Old Brewery Mission. The Old Brewery Mission \u00a0reported that Cloutier was a long-time client who had attended the shelter especially for meals and changes of clothing. Shelter director Matthew Pearce said that Cloutier had participated in a program at Maison Claude-Laram\u00e9e for homeless people with mental health issues, a program run jointly by the shelter and the Douglas Mental Health University Institute (CBC 2017). Cloutier had no attended the shelter for four years after completing the program. Pearce reported that over the past year, Cloutier had been a \u201cfairly frequent visitor\u201d and seemed fine the day of the shooting, stopping by the cafeteria to get coffee (CBC 2017).<\/p>\n<p>Surveillance camera video from the police killing of Cloutier shows the victim tossing a cup of liquid, presumed to be coffee from the shelter, on the ground before bending over, apparently to set something else down, before then picking up a bag and walking out of the view of the camera (CTV Montreal 2017). Cloutier is pursued by several police officers clearly holding firearms. The man was shot and killed only seconds later. Police claim that he was armed and made some \u201caggressive gesture\u201d at them, but this has not been independently confirmed.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed homeless people on the scene were upset that the police had used lethal force against Cloutier and deployed it so quickly. They have asked why no alternatives were attempted first. Police became aggrieve with homeless people on the scene who merely raised questions about the actions taken by police. Those wondering why police chose not to use less-lethal options have continued to raise concerns. According to Milosz Janda, the Old Brewery Mission social counsellor: \u201cThey just want to find out what was the reason for such behaviour? Why was it done that way? Why weren\u2019t other possible approaches there?\u201d (quoted in CTV Montreal 2017).<\/p>\n<p>Cloutier is the fourth homeless person known to have been killed by Montreal police officers in the past few years. This fact is not lost on Old Brewery Mission director Matthew Pearce. He points out the awful history of police engagement with poor and homeless people. According to Pearce: \u201cFour incidents of confrontation with the police, and four deaths. Not injuries \u2013 deaths. I have to feel that in each of those there were other options that could have been pursued\u201d (quoted in CTV Montreal 2017). He suggests that police are too fearful and stressed out by homeless and street involved people.<\/p>\n<p>The circumstances of the police killing of Jimmy Cloutier are all too familiar for family members of other homeless people killed by Montreal Police. Pierre Magloire\u2019s brother Alain was shot and killed by police two years ago. Magloire\u2019s response to this latest killing was dismay. In his words: \u201cI was, like, \u2018Again? Oh my God.\u2019 How come we are at the same place we were two, three years ago?\u201d (quoted in CTV Montreal 2017). He echoes the belief that police are too panicked in dealing with people who may be experiencing distress: \u201cThey are not ready to deal with someone. They are getting afraid very fast\u201d (quoted in CTV Montreal 2017).<\/p>\n<p>These killings are extreme forms of the poorbashing that police regularly inflict on homeless people. It extends from habitual police practices of harassment, intimidation, bullying, and violence. It reflects police perspectives that view homeless people as \u201cproblems\u201d or unworthy victims, or detritus.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>CBC News. 2017. \u201cVideo Shows Final Moments of Old Brewery Mission Client, Shot to Death by Police.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

Kill Ralph Stephens on the Stoney Nakoda First Nation in Alberta (January 7,

Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Canada have their origins as a colonial military force. Their history is one of settlerism and class domination on an ongoing basis. They continue in the present to police and regulate and repress Indigenous communities through targeted violence. This must be remembered in any case of RCMP contact with Indigenous people and communities in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>Alberta RCMP shot and killed Ralph Stephens, 27, on the Stoney Nakoda First Nation near Morley on Saturday, January 7, 2017. Stephens died in hospital about and hour after being shot. Police claim they were on the reserve to execute a warrant for first-degree murder charges related to the death of Lorenzo \u201cBilly\u201d Bearspaw, also 27, whose body was found on the reserve on January 6 after he was reported missing on January 3 by a family member. The other men pursued by RCMP, John Stephens, 29, and Deangelo Powderface, 22, have both been taken into custody by the force. John Stephens was arrested directly prior to the killing of Ralph Stephens. Major Crimes with assistance from the RCMP Emergency Response Team were involved.<\/p>\n<p>No one has said why police opened fire on the victim. Nothing has been reported to suggest he confronted or attacked police. Police have only said that Ralph Stephens \u201cengaged police\u201d but this has not been corroborated by any independent sources or witnesses. Several people were said to be in the residence at which Stephens was killed when the shooting happened.<\/p>\n<p>The dangerous nature of this police action and the prospect it will stoke justified anger toward RCMP are clear. Police seem concerned with dampening any response. Chief Superintendent Tony Hamori, the officer in charge of Southern Alberta made an appeal with no note of accountability or reasons for adherence: \u201cI also urge calm in the community while the investigations take place\u201d (quoted by Anderson 2017).<\/p>\n<p>Community members describe a chaotic scene after police arrived on the scene. According to Gerald Powderface, a relative of Ralph Stephens: \u201cMy family told me it happened so quick, even my cousin was asking them \u2018Have you shot my boy?\u2019 They didn\u2019t even answer him, they just dragged him out of the house without no shoes and they&#8217;re throwing people out of the house left and right. They didn\u2019t even answer his question, \u2018Have you shot my boy? What happened, what\u2019s going on here?\u2019\u201d (quoted in Anderson 2017).<\/p>\n<p>The community has come to the family\u2019s care and support. According to Gerald Powderface: We have a community here that support each other on every matter, especially a matter like that. They all come to the house. There was a lot of people there last night when I left\u201d (quoted in Anderson 2017).<\/p>\n<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating the RCMP actions in killing Ralph Stephens. RCMP continue to maintain an active presence on the reserve since the shooting.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever one might think about this particular case the fact remains that an historic settler colonial force built on dispossession, expropriation, and genocide continues to police Indigenous communities across Canada.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Anderson, Drew. 2017. \u201cMan Shot by RCMP on Stoney Nakoda Reserve is Dead.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

Shelter","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2017\/01\/08\/montreal-police-aggressively-assail-homeless-people-after-killing-man-outside-shelter\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-7n","content":"<p>On Friday, January 6, 2017, Montreal police shot and killed a man outside of the Old Brewery Mission. As if inflicting this trauma on homeless people who witnessed police violence was not enough, police then decided to become aggressive with clients of the shelter. It is suggested that the victim of the police shooting had been a client a of the Mission at various points over the course off 11 years.<\/p>\n<p>According to Matthew Pearce, the Director General of the Old Brewery Mission, police became aggressive with people upset by the use of lethal force. Pearce relates: \u201cI was told there was an incident where someone made a critical remark to the police. And the police reacted with some degree of aggression\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2017). The violent response by police to even mild criticism from the public is too common and raises questions about police views on the communities they claim to protect and serve. Pearce suggests that the response was inappropriate. In his words: \u201cWe feel that the reaction that the police had to that remark was excessive and I&#8217;ll be following up with Montreal&#8217;s police chief\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2017).<\/p>\n<p>Pearce noted too the harm that can be done by actions such as the aggressive police targeting of shelter clients. He notes: \u201cOur role is to reduce tensions at all times so it is a concern to us when third parties like the police are inside our building. We don\u2019t want them to contribute to the creating of issues that we then have to work to resolve\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2017). Yet this sort of behavior is too common among police, particularly where homeless and street involved people are concerned.<\/p>\n<p>The Mission&#8217;s Director General is now working overtime to ensure that people on the street are confident that the mission is a safe place. According to Pearce: \u201cIt\u2019s essential that people, when they come inside the mission, they are leaving the street behind so they are coming to a place of respect of dignity and of security\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2017). A coroner\u2019s investigation earlier suggested that police need improved training when dealing with people who may suffer mental health issues following the killing of a homeless man more than two years ago (CBC News 2016). Psychologists are working with people traumatized by the police action.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>CBC News. 2017. \u201cOld Brewery Mission Seeks to Reassure Clients after Fatal Police Shooting.\u201d CBC News.

What role did the Ontario government play in pushing the OPP to move on the occupiers? Why did the OPP decide to march on the occupiers, taking an aggressive and confrontational approach (a full frontal assault) when there were already plans developed to address the situation through less aggressive means? Why were the OPP armed so heavily and with assault with assault weapons when it was known through a CSIS (Canadian Security and Intelligence Services) mole that the occupiers were unarmed?<\/p>\n<p>Some partial answers to these questions would only come out in the criminal trial of Tex Deane and the public inquiry held a decade after George\u2019s homicide by police. The shooting of Dudley George came a day after newly elected Premier of Ontario, Mike Harris ordered OPP to \u201cget the fucking Indians out of Ipperwash Park\u201d (Ipperwash Inquiry 2007). An aide in the Premier\u2019s office notoriously proclaimed: \u201cThe government will not be seen as cooperating with the Indians.\u201d This was only a day before Dudley George was shot and killed. Yet the deeper answers to these questions are rooted in the general history of colonialism and genocide in Canada and the specific harms inflicted on The Kettle Point and Stony Point communities.<\/p>\n<p>At the heart of policing across the Canadian context is, as it always is in the case of settler colonialism, control of land, Indigenous land. In the Canadian state context policing has always been a military exercise in the service of displacement, dispossession, seizure, securing, and settling of land and, where deemed necessary, re-seizing and re-securing land in those cases where Indigenous communities have organized to reclaim their community lands. The examples in Canadian history are numerous and ongoing. A litany of state organized and state enacted theft. Nothing less. Organized crime at the highest level. The names of incidents of state violence in the seizure of Indigenous lands live in infamy. So too the cases of police assaults carried out in the re-taking of land re-claimed by Indigenous communities. Oka, Gustafsen Lake, Sun Peaks, Caledonia, to name only a few recent ones. And Ipperwash.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>An Ongoing History of Colonial Crimes: Always an Ipperwash Crisis for Indigenous People<\/p>\n<p>The great Shawnee war chief Tecumseh, whose relations moved to Kettle Point, received a lecture from his older brother Chiksika. He said:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen a white man kills an Indian in a fair fight it is called honorable, but when an Indian kills a white man in a fair fight it is called murder&#8230; When an Indian is killed it is a great loss which leaves a gap in our people and a sorrow in our heart; when a white is killed, three or four others step up to take his place and there is no end to it. The white man seeks to conquer nature, to bend it to his will and use it wastefully&#8230;The whole white race is a monster who is always hungry and what he eats is land.\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 33)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The story of the OPP Ipperwash police assault and the killing of Dudley George is rooted in a historic theft of land by the Canadian government for purposes of war. On July 10, 1827, Chief Wawanosh would conclude a treaty that would see King George IV acquire around 2,200,000 acres of prime land in Southwestern Ontario. The treaty would see the establishment of the Kettle and Stony Point reserves with a measly 5000 acres combined. The treaty conference that gave rise to the Kettle and Stony Point reserves came from a concern over land squatting (theft) by white settlers. In return the Indigenous communities received a promise that the Crown would provide living payments \u201cannually and forever\u201d (Edwards 2001, 39). Yet the Crown came to this agreement clearly intending that forever would be a very short time, if the Indigenous population decreased and, indeed, disappeared. The genocidal intentions, or at least expectations, of government, settlers, and missionaries were not hidden beneath the surface.<\/p>\n<p>Primitive accumulation in the Canadian context occurred according to a brutal explicit calculus. This was made clear in crude terms by Reverend Thomas Hurlburt, Methodist missionary to Kettle and Stony Point and the city of Sarnia. In 1864 Reverend Hurlburt wrote in a piece in the <em>Lambton County Gazeteer and Genneral Business Directory<\/em> to lay out the mathematics of genocide for the general public. He stated:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the easiest and cheapest way to dispose of the Indians of North America; for they must be disposed of in one of three ways; killed in war or by drink or Christianized by missionaries and thus made useful members of society&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHaving been in the mission among the Indians for the past 35 years, and having lived and labored among them in that capacity, I am acquainted with most of the tribes from Texas to the Hudson\u2019s Bay territory, as well as in Canada, I have taken pains to gather the statistics of various Indian wars\u2014the Florida, Black Hawks and others, and I find it requires $25,000 to dispose of an Indian by war, in addition to one white man being killed for every Indian. To dispose of them by drink I found by the statistics of those tribes who had large annuities, and consequently drunk much, that it required about $2,000 to kill an Indian by whiskey&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn taking the statistics of our own Indian missions, I find it requires about $200 to Cristianize and civilize an Indian, and train him twenty years and thus give him a chance for both his life and that which is to come. Thus it is seen that it requires as much to kill an Indian in war as would Christianize 125, and train them twenty years. It requires as much to kill an Indian by whiskey as would Christianize and save ten. There are 125,000 Indians in British North America.\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 41)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is the market calculus, the marketization of genocide. It is the logic that would give rise to the horrors of the residential schools and cultural erasure. This is the ongoing logic of colonialism that would find expression, sometimes explicit, in the Ipperwash crisis. It has economic, political, and cultural aspects.<\/p>\n<p>A letter sent by agent A. Dingman of Strathroy to Prime Minister John A. Macdonald on August 27, 1884 and marked \u201cConfidential\u201d told a story of systematic theft of the resources of the reserve lands. In the letter Dingman recorded the activities of a timber mill owner A.L. Smith who operated in the area. The mill had been set up by the capitalist to ensure cloaked thievery. Noting that white settlers had stripped non-reserve lands of resources, Dingman reports:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cand there is now absolutely no place from which it is practicable to get logs with which to stock the mill except they come off the Indian Reserves. It is situated in such an out-of-the-way place that any person so disposed could easily get logs off the Reserves and few people would be aware of the fact unless they were specially interested in finding it out&#8230;.If the object was to plunder the Reserves of timber no better place could be found than the spot where the mill is situated.\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 42)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As was common across the area of Ontario, the capitalist represented himself as an agent of the government. Smith had even constructed a phony title for himself, \u201cforest bailiff,\u201d a position that did not actually exist in Ontario. In a scheme that brought together the recent push to Christianize the communities the capitalist concocted a deal to return some sawed boards to the community for sue in building a church the newly converted now wanted. As Dingman reported: \u201cnever a board was used on the church. This process was repeated time and time again until fully $5,000 worth of timber was cut and sawed into timber, but not one board went towards building the church\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 42). Still the cutting for profit brought the woods to the point of being barren of trees.<\/p>\n<p>Dingman suggested that the trees at Stony Point might not survive another winter of plunder (Edwards 2001, 42). While settlers for miles around had fences for their farms, the Native farmers had no wood for their own fences (Edwards 2001, 43).<\/p>\n<p>There were no charges brought by the Government of Canada against any of the settlers or capitalists who had stolen from the Indigenous communities. Nor was anyone held responsible for government corruption or incompetence (Edwards 2001, 43). The government of Prime Minister Macdonald protected capitalist interests in Treaty 242 of 1888 which gave the federal government permission to sell Native timber rights in exchange for minimal cooperation. Notably the failure of the government to meet wartime promises to provide compensation for wartime service in the War of 1812 persisted throughout the community. Similar struggles would play out over service in subsequent wars up through the twentieth century.<\/p>\n<p>In 1927 a group of land speculators with connections in Ottawa turned their greedy eyes to reserve lands on the shores of Lake Huron. Band members were offered bribes of five dollars if they voted to surrender the lands to developers. An additional ten dollars was offered if the vote to surrender the lands was approved by council (Edwards 2001, 45). Despite the fact that the lands were located at Kettle Point, the vote (and the bribes) were offered to men of both bands. In the end the 33 acres of parkland were purchased by speculators for eighty-five dollars per acre. Half was resold immediately by the developers who had a pre-existing deal for three hundred dollars and acre. The Kettle Point band received $7706.20 for land that developers received $13,200 in selling only half.<\/p>\n<p>Years later the Indian Claims Commission ruled that the federal government had cheated the community as government Indian agents abandoned the duty to protect by looking away as the deal went down. By that point cottagers had held the land for generations (Edwards 2001, 46).<\/p>\n<p>In 1936 the Stoney Point community were deprived of more of their land, when the Province of Ontario purchased 108 acres of land that had been sold the previous year to private actors (Edwards 2001, 46). The land would be used for none other than Ipperwash Provincial Park.<\/p>\n<p>When workers preparing the park uncovered evidence of a Native burial ground appeals were made to government by band council to fence that area off from development. Despite official letters from provincial and federal governments approving of this request the fence was never built. The area would become a picnic grounds complete with horseshoe pits (Edwards 2001, 46).<\/p>\n<p>The history of land theft by capital, settlers, and government against the Kettle Point and Stony Point communities would continue as war loomed in Europe in the late 1930s. The Canadian government desired a military training ground in Ontario (centrally located in the province with the country\u2019s largest population). Businesses desired a facility in the area sine they could profit greatly servicing and supplying the base. Local businesses saw dollar signs in providing the base with fruit, vegetables, grains, bread, oil, canned goods, garbage removal, etc. as had been the\u00a0 case with a base at Pinehill Camp (Edwards 2001, 46-47). That base was closed due to lack of running water on site, a great loss for profit seeking local capital. Stoney Point provided an ideal site right on the shores of Lake Huron and with water running all through it (Edwards 2001, 47).<\/p>\n<p>In addition to its beneficial geographical qualities, Stoney Point offered a political benefit in that the Natives of Stoney Point did not have the vote and could not punish the government or local representatives at the voting booth. Another benefit for the government was financial. The Department of National Defence appraised the Stoney Point lands in 1942 at fifteen dollars per acre, which was much less than market value for nearby non-reserve lands. Economically, Native lands were viewed as \u201cnon-productive\u201d (as long as Natives held them) despite the fact that they were directly farmed for food and essential for community purposes. The notion that Indigenous held lands were non-productive is one that returned to the center of federal government ideology under the Conservative Party regime of Stephen Harper in the 2000s as his government sought to convert Indigenous lands to marketable properties.<\/p>\n<p>While the land deal would be put to a vote of the Stoney Point community a letter from the Secretary of Indian Affairs was sent to the local Indian agent stating that the government was \u201cprepared to use the War Measures Act if the \u00a0Indians refused a surrender\u201d (Edwards 2001, 47). Some vote then. Some democracy. Appropriately, on April Fools\u2019 Day 1942 the Stoney Point band voted on the\u00a0 fate of the lands. Members fighting overseas would not even get a vote. Under the government plan they would turn over the full 2211 acres of their land, all houses, and farms for a sum of $50,000.<\/p>\n<p>Indigenous community members suggested a counter-proposal to lease the land to the federal government for the duration of the war but Ottawa rejected this. And why not? They had an ace up their sleeve. The vote showed a rejection of the government plan with the proposal being defeated 59-13 (Edwards 2001, 48). Never mind the \u201cdemocratic\u201d result. The government turned to their back up plan. On April 14, 1942, the federal government passed an order-in-council effecting an appropriation of the <em>entire<\/em> Stoney Point reserve.<\/p>\n<p>Despite concerns among the federal Department of Justice about the legality of taking lands against the stated will of the community, the War Measures Act took the houses and land of the people of Stoney Point in the same manner as would also be imposed on supposed \u201cenemy aliens\u201d such as Japanese civilians (Edwards 2001, 48). Eighteen Stoney Point families were removed from their homes and lands and transferred to the Kettle Point reserve. They were merged into one band and reduced to one federally recognized chief. The Department of Indian Affairs which was supposed to look out for the interests of Indigenous communities (but rarely if ever did) raised not an eyebrow. In fact they viewed the move as a punitive measure to better oversee and regulate the people once they were in a closer space. One Indian agent even reported the dispossession and displacement as a great opportunity to round up a \u201cfew straggling Indians\u201d (Edwards 2001, 49). To add insult to injury the government changed the name of the band from Stoney Point to Stony Point for unclear, bureaucratic, reasons. Their former land became Canadian Forces Base at Ipperwash (CFB Ipperwash).<\/p>\n<p>Notably such a move for land expropriation would never have been considered against local white farmers or business property owners. Yet the area around the Stoney Point lands were being developed for less than essential purposes such as tourist resorts and weekend getaways for white visitors from the cities and from the United States. Those lands could have been appropriated with less impact on an existing community. The racist perspective of colonialism would not allow for consideration of such a move.<\/p>\n<p>Residents of Stoney Point were moved without notification or even time to pack. As one displaced member Pearl George related: \u201cWhen we came home, our house was up on jacks and our two log cabins were gone. They didn\u2019t tell us anything&#8230;They never even let u know they were coming so we could pack up the little things. A lot of things were broken. They moved us to Kettle Point, to a swamp\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 49). Three of her children born at Kettle Point would die after developing intestinal problems that she attributed to the swamp[ water. The displaced felt like strangers in another land. As Maynard George, a son of Pearl, would state: It was sort of like in Bosnia where they put two different ethnic groups together. They did not allocate us good wood or housing. We could not become members of the band council or get any work on the reserve\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 50). This made no difference to government and likely never even registered at all. Other homes were simply levelled rather than moved. This was the fate suffered by the small church at Stoney Point as well as by many of the headstones in a nearby cemetery.<\/p>\n<p>One can try to imagine the feelings of soldiers such as Clifford George who returned to a levelled land after having risked his life fighting in Europe (for the very state that was stealing and bulldozing his home while he faced enemy fire). He would\u00a0 later reflect: \u201cI came home to nothing. I\u2019ll never forget the feeling I had when I first went there [to Stoney Point] and couldn\u2019t find my mother\u2019s grave. They had removed the headstones and there were bullet holes and trenches dug. They could only do that to an Indian. That would never happen to white people\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 52). With no home to return to George would move to a nearby town. He would be stripped of his legal Indian status. In his words: \u201cI came back to find the real enemy was here\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 53).<\/p>\n<p>The Canadian government had promised the Stony Point community that their lands would be returned to them at cessation of the fighting at war\u2019s end. Following the end of World War Two the Transitional Powers Act replaced the War Measures Act setting the stage for a social transition to post-war conditions.<\/p>\n<p>On May 31, 1946, the advanced infantry training center at CFB Ipperwash was closed. The Department of National Affairs and Department of Indian Affairs opened discussions about returning the confiscated lands to the Indigenous community. On December 31, 1946, the Transitional Powers Act expired and the stolen lands had still not been returned. Yet no extension was granted for the Department of National Defense to retain the Stony Point lands. The government had no legal basis to keep the lands. But it did.<\/p>\n<p>In this context life went on. And grew. Dudley George was born on March 17, 1957 at Sarnia General Hospital. Anthony O\u2019Brien George was the eighth of ten children in a family that lived at the Sarnia reserve after his family\u2019s community was destroyed by the Canadian government 15 years before Dudley was born. Ironically he got his nickname Dudley after the character Dudley Do-Right a clueless Mountie featured in Saturday morning cartoons (Edwards 2001, 55). His family would move to Kettle Point when he was eight.<\/p>\n<p>The efforts by Stony Point members to reclaim their land did not cease at any point during the period in which their lands were controlled by the Canadian government. Future Prime Minister Jean Chretien, then Minister of Indian Affairs noted in a letter to the Minister of National Defense in 1972:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSince 1946 our respective Departments have been corresponding on the subject of the return of some 2,200 acres comprising Canadian Forces Base Camp Ipperwash which was appropriated in 1942 by the Department of National Defence under the War Measures Act&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Chippewas of Kettle Point have repeatedly requested the return of these lands which are needed to enable the Band to improve its economic and social position. Time has not altered the Indians\u2019 view that they were wronged by the forcible taking of their reserve in 1942. Moreover, it was their understanding that the land was to have been returned to them at the end of hostilities.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith cuts in the Canadian Forces Bases indicated it seems to me that this is an appropriate time to reconsider this matter and I would appreciate having advice as to your Department\u2019s plans for Camp Ipperwash. The transfer of this land to the administration and control of this Department so that it could be returned to reserve status would be of great importance to the Kettle Point Indians and would remove a major source of dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Federal Government have dealt with this reserve.\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 58)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Nothing came of this of course. Of note, Chretien had become Prime Minister of Canada at the time the Ipperwash reclamation occupation, and shooting of Dudley George, occurred. Yet he did nothing as Prime Minister to improve a situation of injustice that he was clearly aware needed to be redressed and had be aware of for decades.<\/p>\n<p>In 1950 the park superintendent\u2019s wife had reported the discovery of human bones. By 1972 the government seemed to have forgotten about all discussions around fencing off the burial ground or about the discovery of bones.<\/p>\n<p>The Canadian government made a payment of 2.5 million dollars to the Kettle and Stony Point band in 1980 as partial compensation for the base lands. This was accompanied by a promise that the lands would be returned when military use had finally ceased (Edwards 2001, 60). In March 1992 a report was tabled by the Standing Committee on Aboriginal People recommending that the federal government return the Camp Ipperwash lands to the Stony Point community.<\/p>\n<p>The people themselves followed this recommendation up a month later when a gathering of 100 showed up at Camp Ipperwash to serve an eviction notice on the Department of National Defense. The government was given 20 days to leave the premises (Edwards 2001, 61). The group of 100 included members of the National Association of Japanese Canadians. Their representative Van Hori noted that his community had also lost their homes and had their land expropriated by the government during World War Two. He stated: \u201cIt took us forty-six years to get an apology and some kind of compensation&#8230;These people are still waiting\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 61). The Department of National Defense replied in August 1992 that there was still a need to keep the Camp Ipperwash lands.<\/p>\n<p>For many in the community the time for waiting was over. Fifty years had passed since the government stole the lands. Forty-six years since the promised time of return. On May 27, 1993 the military base was reoccupied by an Indigenous group calling itself now the Stoney Point First Nation. They named the reclaimed lands Aushoodaana Anjibaajrg meaning \u201cresting place.\u201d Dudley George was among that original group of land reclaimers.<\/p>\n<p>The occupiers built homes on the base, pitched tents, parked trailers. The soldiers at the base remained doing what exercises they could. The occupation grew to around 100 residents with dozens more visiting regularly and offering support. Indigenous groups from across Turtle Island sent visitors. The Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) offered solidarity in the form of timber for buildings and generators for power (Edwards 2001, 62). The happiness in the community was real. As Clifford George stated: \u201cThis is the first time in fifty years, since before the war, that we\u2019ve all been together so close. We\u2019re finally back together again, and that\u2019s why we have such a good relationship&#8230;.I\u2019m back to stay. They\u2019ll have to carry me off and they better lock me up because the minute they let me loose, I\u2019ll come back again\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 62). The community elected its own chief and council (outside the formal structures of the colonial Indian Act). This was an assertion of self-determination and self-governance. Traditional teachings were practiced. A peace tree was planted over a traditional stone axe. A month in the first permanent structure, a church, was completed (Edwards 2001, 63).<\/p>\n<p>The military kept up low level Bell 212 helicopter flights for reconnaissance shining lights into the occupation camp. According to Clifford George: \u201cSometimes they flew so low they raised dust. They scare the kids and old people. I\u2019m all in favour of laying of charges of harassment against the military\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 64). The helicopter crews that harassed the Stoney Point people had flown missions in the colonial deployment in Somalia.<\/p>\n<p>The media war was also initiated against the Indigenous occupiers. Media began to portray them as terrorists not as a cheated community striving after decades to get their stolen lands back. In this the media were replaying by now well rehearsed narratives of Indigenous resistance as terrorism or criminality. Such discourses had only recently been trotted out and repeated for national and even international audiences during the Oka crisis of 1990.<\/p>\n<p>In the federal budget speech of 1994 the government announced plans to negotiate the return of Camp Ipperwash lands. No date was given.<\/p>\n<p>Enough was finally more than enough. On July 29, 1995, Stoney Point occupiers drove a yellow school bus through the doors of a base hall and refused to leave. The military simply withdrew. By the end of summer community members had secured contracts to maintain the base at ten dollars per hour. There was no violence.<\/p>\n<p>On Monday, September 4, Labor Day, 1995, the Indigenous protesters occupied Ipperwash Provincial Park, as they had, in fact, promised to do. There were about 35 occupiers in the park on the first evening. Police knew from the start that this occupation differed from other recent occupations such as Oka in Quebec and Gustafsen Lake in British Columbia. Their own briefing notes reported \u201cno visible weapons\u201d (Edwards 2001, 75). And their observers suggested the occupation was not well organized.<\/p>\n<p>Still police right away put in motion plans to move more than 200 officers to the area along with caged Corrections Canada buses (Edwards 2001, 75). The Forest arena was commandeered as an arrest center. Police had also made arrangements with the Canadian military for use of armored personnel carriers. Project Maple was underway. The social war character of the police operation and response to Indigenous occupiers was unescapable. It would soon claim its casualties.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Police Assault on Ipperwash and the Killing of Dudley George<\/p>\n<p>Throughout Tuesday, September 5, and Wednesday, September 6, 1995, dozens of out of town officers appeared in the area near the camp and park. There was a mass mobilization of police force which seemed well out of proportion given the small numbers of community occupiers and the peaceful, by all accounts, nature of the protest.<\/p>\n<p>Police roadblocks were set up on roads around the park and drivers were stopped and questioned. Indigenous drivers and passengers were subjected to particularly lengthy interrogations by police. The night of the police assault police shut down all roads around the park and military base sealing the protesters off from the outside world. Dozens of police vehicles, including containment vans, had been massed outside the park.<\/p>\n<p>Numerous people, like Kettle and Stony Point band councillor Cecil Bernard, told OPP officers during the occupation that the occupiers were \u201cgood, peaceful people\u201d (Edwards 2001, 1). They also noted that they felt that the officers did not care or were almost disappointed to hear this.<\/p>\n<p>On the evening of the lethal police raid that killed Dudley George there were only about 25 people inside the park and this included some children (Edwards 2001, 2). The occupiers had no weapons in the park. In fact weapons had been banned by occupiers who realized they could not win in a shootout with police, which they did not seek anyway, and having weapons could be potentially disastrous.<\/p>\n<p>The police maneuvers that resulted in the killing of Dudley George were military in character. The riot squad, the Crowd Management Unit, that moved on the camp was made up of the OPP Tactics and Rescue Unit (TRU) a paramilitary formation (Edwards 2001, 3). They consisted of scouts and snipers. It was never quite clear how the decision to send in the TRU was ever arrived at and ordered.<\/p>\n<p>At one point earlier in the evening they had almost claimed a different victim, also unarmed. A TRU sniper had eyed what he believed to be an Indigenous person with a rifle standing at the side of the road. He also saw what he believed to be the reddish glow from a night vision riffle scope. What happened next is chilling. The officer reported into his radio: \u201cCMU [Crowd Management Unit] be advised party on road may have a weapon in his hand. Check CMU person on the road does have a weapon, does have a weapon. Everybody move. Right, left, quick right, left, quick right, left, quick right, left, everybody quick right. Left\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 3). The sniper dropped into position taking aim on the figure, awaiting the order to \u201cFire.\u201d The man was that close to being dead. As automatic weapons trained on him snipers confirmed the perceived threat. A police scout: \u201cConfirm one man with weapon\u2014long gun\u201d (Edwards 2001, 3). That close.<\/p>\n<p>But the police were mistaken. A message from Constable Mark Beauchene to Acting Sergeant Ken Deane clarified that the man in the crosshairs did not actually have a gun at all. He carried a walking stick. The red glow from the night sight\u2014a lit cigarette (Edwards 2001, 3). And he was that close to being killed right then and there. Under eerily similar circumstances of police error and confusion Dudley George would not escape with such fortune.<\/p>\n<p>Still the CMU continued their ill advised march on the camp. Near the park entrance protesters would see about 30 of them marching toward them in a tight box formation. Years before concerns would be more constantly raised about the militarization of policing, this formation of the riot squad came forward in head to toe body armor, with shin and elbow pads, holding Plexiglas shields and steel batons. They wore heavy helmets not meant to communicate with those they were approaching (to serve and protect of course). Rather their intended communications were only with each other. The helmets were equipped with internal microphones.<\/p>\n<p>Police began pounding on the shields with their batons, \u201cshield chatter,\u201d in the tried and true attempt to intimidate, distract, and terrorize. This was nothing less than a military formation on a military maneuver. It was designed to frighten and threaten and, if necessary, to inflict lethal force. It had no other purpose or intent.<\/p>\n<p>In response the protesters were not fully intimidated. Some turned high powered spotlights on the officers. Lights, symbolically, ironically, illuminating a situation from the history of Canadian settler colonialism\u2014the deployment of military force to drive Indigenous people off of their lands. And the protesters were explicit that they recognized and understood this. They responded to the CMU appropriately: \u201cThis is our traditional land. Our forefathers were here before you! Get back on the <em>Mayflower<\/em>! Go back with the Pilgrims\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 5). And: \u201cYou\u2019re stealing our land! Go back to England! Get the fuck off our land!\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 5). The land reclaimers were justly defiant. They were no aggressive or violent. None of that mattered to police who were impatient to deploy force against the protesters (for reasons not immediately apparent perhaps but politically significant).<\/p>\n<p>Riot squad officers initially made a raid against Indigenous people in the parking lot. Police adopted a spread formation, standing wide apart to look more menacing and to avoid projectiles (Edwards 2001, 5). Moments later the police charged the group again. Indigenous protesters were beaten, at least one into unconsciousness. Later in the attack a dog that was with the protesters would be shot and killed by police. In the end, in addition to Dudley George, 16-year-old Nicholas Cottrelle would also be shot in the volleys of dozens of bullets fired by police at Indigenous protesters. Cecil Slippery George would be beaten almost to death by police. A dog that was with Cottrelle on a bus the youth tried to drive out of danger was also shot and killed.<\/p>\n<p>Ken \u201cTex\u201d Deane, the officer\u00a0 who shot and killed Dudley George, was armed with an East German Heckler and Koch submachine gun. It fired 800 rounds a minute. Deane had been on duty for sixteen hours. Another officer, Sergeant George Hebblethwaite, second in command of the riot squad, recognized that George appeared to be holding only a stick (Edwards 2001, 10). Yet, in what would be found in a trial and inquiry after the killing to be unwarranted and unjustifiable use of force, Deane opened fire anyway. Deane hit George with what were the second and third volleys of bullets he fired. The third volley delivered the lethal shot.<\/p>\n<p>Dudley George&#8217;s sister Carolyn and brother Pierre tried\u00a0 frantically to get their stricken sibling to the local hospital for urgently needed care. They placed him in a car and made a desperate run for the hospital. What played out was an horrific expression of police vengeance and pettiness. Police attempted at every turn to stop the vehicle carrying the badly wounded Dudley George and the frantic effort to save his life saw the vehicle circumvent several would be roadblocks and out-maneuver the police pursuit. \u00a0Incredibly they managed to get Dudley to Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital in Strathroy, Ontario. The nightmare did not end when they got there.<\/p>\n<p>Police chose to arrest and detain Pierre George and Carolyn George, who delivered Dudley to the hospital, rather than get the dying man immediate medical attention. Young Nicolas Cottrelle, only 16, who was also shot by police would\u00a0 himself be charged by police with attempted murder. With 28 blunt force trauma wounds across his body delivered by police, Slippery George was charged with assault. The laying of charges against people who have been violently attacked by police is a standard practice that is all too familiar to people who have engaged in political protests in Canada. It is a practice that has become routine.<\/p>\n<p>Dudley\u2019s brother Pierre and sister Carolyn, who had so desperately tried to save their brother\u2019s life were put in the Strathroy town jail and each charged with attempted murder. Police at the jail refused to answer Pierre George\u2019s repeated requests to find out how Dudley was. Somehow though they knew.<\/p>\n<p>Dudley George suffered fractures of the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs on his left side, a cracked collar bone, and had two large fragments of bullets in the subcutaneous soft tissues (Edwards 2001, 20). The young man, a beloved jokester, was declared dead at 12:20 AM on September 7, 1995, at nearby Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital, in Strathroy, Ontario.<\/p>\n<p>Anthony O&#8217;Brien George (March 17, 1957\u2013September 7, 1995), known to friends and family as Dudley, was the eighth of ten children born to Genevi\u00e8ve (\u201cJenny\u201d) Pauline Rogers George and Reg \u201cNug\u201d (Reginald Ransford) George.<\/p>\n<p>Kettle and Stony Point Chief, Tom Bressette, described the sense of terror inflicted on the community by police. In his words: \u201cOur elders were fleeing the community&#8230;They were afraid the army would come back with the police and kill them\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 22). The history of violence inflicted on the community and the immediate killing of their neighbor Dudley gave them ample reason to feel threatened. As would be revealed in the pubic inquiry held years later the community without fully knowing it perhaps had larger political reasons to be fearful. The government was fully prepared to deploy, indeed desired, police terror against the community to break the occupation.<\/p>\n<p>The morning after the killing of Dudley George, Premier Harris refused to meet with Chief Bressette, Assembly of First Nations head Ovid Mercredi, and Ontario Chief Gord Peters. Harris referred to the occupation as illegal even though senior government ministers knew it was likely fully legal given the existence of burial grounds in the park (Edwards 2001, 118). The claim of Indigenous illegality was a claim Harris would repeat publicly even days later. After the killing the military tried to denigrate Dudley George by suggesting he had an \u201cextreme criminal record\u201d (Edwards 2001, 116). This was in no way accurate. He had one arrest as a youth (in an event for which white youth also involved were never even charged).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Racism and Colonialism Continued: Law and Order Conservatism and the Ipperwash Siege<\/p>\n<p>The community members believed early on that Conservative Premier Mike Harris was responsible for the lethal police operation. Harris and his hard Right neoliberal Conservative Party government had only been elected three months before the killing of Dudley George. His government had made clear in their election campaign that they would make poor and working class communities scapegoats for social discontent and economic uncertainty. The suffering of the poor and unemployed would pay for social programs desired by the wealthy (through a massive transfer of social wealth away from services needed by the poorest members of society). They were an openly reactionary force for capital and fierce proponents of a neoliberal austerity agenda and tough on crime politics of repression.<\/p>\n<p>Under the banner of their so-called \u201cCommon Sense Revolution\u201d the Harris Tories launched a counter-revolutionary assault against poor people, welfare recipients, unions, students, community groups, and progressives of all types. At one point a year into his term Harris would target even sociologists (who were critical of anti-social government policy) labeling the discipline as \u201cwaste in the system\u201d of post-secondary education.<\/p>\n<p>Harris had, as official Opposition leader, made his racist views on Indigenous communities, and common sense, known to a group of business people (his people) at the Elmhurst Resort near Peterborough. According to Harris: \u201cThere\u2019s a whole notion of guilt&#8230;because Native people haven\u2019t fully adapted from the reservations [reserves] to being full partners in this economy. We can\u2019t let that guilt preclude us from reaching a common sense solution\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 26). Common sense to Harris was justification for ongoing colonialism. Hs was, on the whole, an agenda of ramped up violence in service of primitive accumulation and renewed conditions for exploitation more favorable to capital (against policies and programs that offered some buffer for the working class and oppressed.<\/p>\n<p>Among the changes introduced early by Premier Harris was the ending of employment equity legislation that would have had employers make plans to hire visible minorities, women, and Indigenous people (Edwards 2001, 26). This was the common sense counter-revolution for Ontario. Notably this agenda would be taken nationally when the revamped Conservative Party under Stephen Harper came to power between 2005 and 2015 with several veterans of Harris\u2019s Common Sense Revolution as ministers in the federal cabinet.<\/p>\n<p>From the start police were aware that they were being watched closely by the Premier\u2019s office and Conservative Party. The first day of the operation Conservative MPP Marcel Beaubien arrived on the scene and was in communication with the government at Queen\u2019s Park. The earliest government meetings expressed an intention to \u201cremove the occupiers ASAP\u201d (Edwards 2001, 80). The Conservative Party had campaigned on a hard law and order platform of zero tolerance for even minor offenses and the quelling of political dissent. The Premier\u2019s office sought to use the excuse of break and enter or property damage to push it law and order agenda and sought signs of weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Conservative MPP Beaubien released a press statement replaying racist claims about a two-tiered justice system that was soft on Natives, compared, again in racist fashion, to non[-Native people who were presented as \u201claw abiding and tax paying citizens\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 82). The Indigenous community members were described as \u201cirresponsible, law breaking dissidents\u201d despite the fact that the occupation had not been declared illegal by anyone formally or charges prepared (quoted in Edwards 2001, 82). These claims played on racist tropes familiar in the history of Canadian colonialism and cultural erasure of Indigenous peoples. To add a further racist plum MPP Beaubien tried to distinguish between \u201cyour decent native citizen\u201d and \u201cthugs\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 82). Another referent from Canadian colonial discourse.<\/p>\n<p>MPPs like Beaubien were ratcheting up tensions and calling on the Premier\u2019s office for a forceful and swift intervention. Pressure was also coming from Conservative Party supporters. A letter from a local lawyer to the government was circulated saying in part: \u201cThe Conservative government had a large law and order plank in its platform\u2014I want to see it live up to its election promises and my expectations. I want to see Ipperwash Provincial Park remain in the public domain, and I want the law enforced to see that it does\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 88). The letter writer raised the clich\u00e9d specter of anarchy and showed little regard for the wellbeing of protesters: \u201cThe time to act, and act decisively, is now. If people are hurt, so be it\u2014the laws must be enforced to be respected&#8230;.If illegal acts are tolerated, they spread. The end result is anarchy\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 88). This from a lawyer promoting illegal police action against Indigenous people who, on the basis of the known burial site on the lands were not actually acting illegally (which it turns out the government was aware of). An open call for potential extrajudicial execution of land defenders.<\/p>\n<p>Ironically the statement offered a note that expressed the very situation of the Indigenous community that had waited 50 years to get their land back. It read: \u201cPeople begin to perceive the government cannot protect them and their interests\u2014they begin to take steps to protect themselves\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 88). Meant as a threat this actually explained the situation of the land reclaimers who were being targeted for condemnation.<\/p>\n<p>The appeals of the non-Natives and the racist messaging was not lost o the government which agreed with such sentiments. In meetings of the provincial Emergency Planning Committee, notes show clearly that the Conservative government would accept no compromise and would accept nothing, in fact, except the forced removal of the reclaimers. The government would not negotiate. Neither would they consider, incredibly, that the Indigenous people actually had legitimate claims on the lands. This intransigence was in place even as experts informed them that there were no legal grounds for removal of the occupiers. Stunningly, the government\u2019s own files contained proof of the existence of the burial ground inside the park.<\/p>\n<p>The government had already decided to seek an <em>ex parte<\/em> injunction against the Indigenous protesters. This would ban them from making any argument of their case in the courts, excluding them from the process. It was a measure usually reserved for extreme cases (Edwards 2001, 91). Excluded from the hearing they could not argue or provide evidence for their reasons for being on the land. The police were granted the <em>ex parte<\/em> injunction for four days.<\/p>\n<p>Notes show that the government asked police to remove the protesters and showed frustration that the police did not do so immediately. The government wanted \u201cto be seen as acting\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 89). The government even rejected possible assistance from Kettle and Stony Point band chief Tom Bressette. According to notes: \u201cThis government will not be seen as cooperating with the Indians\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 90).<\/p>\n<p>Racism played an active part in the approach taken by police as well as by government. Protesters reported police hurling racist epithets at them throughout the occupation and police assault on the reclamation camp and saying Dudley George, by name, would \u201cbe the first\u201d (Edwards 2001, 86). Police communication suggested that Native occupiers had been drinking even though there was no sign they were drinking and that they had, in fact, said they wanted no drinking among people at the site. According to police transcripts, OPP Superintendent Anthony Parkin said of the land reclaimers: \u201cThey\u2019re probably all boozed up. They\u2019ve probably been drinking\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 98). The police also suggested cynically that some occupiers were leaving because they knew trouble was coming. Yet they had actually left because they had school and jobs to go to (Edwards 2001, 98). This fact never occurred to police steeped in colonial racist ideology of unemployed, uneducated, Natives. The police also played on racist constructions of Indigenous people as untrustworthy and crooked. Toward this end the police spread rumors in the local area about native occupiers stealing gas. This was designed to stoke suspicion and anger among local farmers, business people, and town residents.<\/p>\n<p>Police and government documents would show a close relationship between the provincial government and the OPP, even in contravention of law and public policy separating government from policing operations. OPP Commissioner Thomas O\u2019Grady was a member of a joint crisis team that met regularly beginning one month before Dudley George was killed by police. So close was the relationship that the OPP had been nicknamed the \u201cOntario Political Police\u201d (Edwards 2001, 120). The joint team was viewed as a legitimate vehicle <em>for<\/em> government.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Social War Policing and the Killing of Dudley George<\/p>\n<p>In a case that underlines the state-capital nexus in policing, and the police as social war defenders of capital, the police also received an armored personnel carrier directly from the manufacturer, GM Diesel, in the nearby city of London, Ontario. Of note, the factory had a special agreement with the London police to provide it armored vehicles in times of police need. The only conceivable possible need was crowd control and anti-protest maneuvers.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0 infamous Chief of Police for London at the time, one Julian Fantino (known for racial profiling during his time as chief in York, Ontario and for keeping a list of gay men while in London) agreed to loan a vehicle to the OPP for the siege of Ipperwash. Fantino would, several years later, be head of the OPP at the time of the Six Nations occupation at Caledonia, Ontario. There the police would notoriously assault the occupation in violation of the recommendations that arose following the police murder of Dudley George. OPP under Fantino would also protect white supremacists who sought to attack the Six Nations reclamation.<\/p>\n<p>The military nature of the police action was further reinforced with the use of air cover through helicopter flyovers. Occupiers had noted surveillance by low flying police helicopters as well as shoreline patrols by a police boat. The Indigenous land reclaimers were being encircled on land and in the air. And even by water. Around the clock. This was a full on military siege. At the same time they actually consisted of a grand total of nine people, including three children (Edwards 2001, 80). At one point a police helicopter buzzed so low on a picnic of women and children that it blew their food off the table (Edwards 2001, 86).<\/p>\n<p>The OPP made informal requests for help to the Canadian military. OPP were in communication with the military over a plan to outnumber Natives ten to one (rather than the two to one ratio in effect when Dudley George was killed). Unfortunately for their plan available troops were preparing to fight an external imperial battle in Bosnia.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Surveillance and Police Spies<\/p>\n<p>As in traditional military operations the state also deployed special ops against the occupiers. At least one spy provided information over a period of time to both CSIS and the OPP. The one identified spy was Jim Moses, a journalist who had contributed to various Indigenous media as well as mainstream outlets like the state broadcaster the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and its investigative newsmagazine <em>The Fifth Estate<\/em> (Edwards 2001, 69). CSIS was particularly interested in involvement by or connections with the Mohawk Warrior Society, noted for activism and community defense at Akwesasne and Oka. Moses reported being paid around $2000 by the OPP over almost three years of spying on Indigenous groups. CSIS paid between 400 dollars and 800 dollars per month (Edwards 2001, 69).<\/p>\n<p>Notably, over his period with the Stoney Point occupiers Moses could find and report no wrongdoing by the group. This despite the fact that it would have been beneficial financially for him to do so. Moses went on to stay with the occupiers at the military base. He never saw any guns at the occupation. He regarded Dudley George as a joker rather than a fighter or leader (Edwards 2001, 70). He expressed deep sadness at George\u2019s killing. In his words: \u201cDudley was a happy-go-lucky friendly guy&#8230;I was sick. I felt empty&#8230;It was totally unnecessary\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 70). This from the police infiltrator.<\/p>\n<p>The OPP also used officers posing as tourists to spy on Indigenous people along the park beach. In addition two undercover officers were placed in the camp posing as campers. They operated out of a trailer and a mobile home (Edwards 2001, 70). Notably they too had nothing threatening or ominous to report about the activities of the occupiers.<\/p>\n<p>The OPP\u2019s military Tactics and Rescue Unit had been formed specifically to address terrorism (in the period before 9\/11). It\u2019s deployment and dubious use in this situation show both the government view of Indigenous land defense and the misuse for purely politically opportunistic purposes various \u201canti-terror\u201d mechanisms. Notably the police construction of Indigenous land defenders as terrorists continues in recent surveillance and response to Indigenous pipeline resistance in the twenty-first century.<\/p>\n<p>The police, despite massive surveillance and\u00a0 an infiltrator in the occupation camp, had no evidence, at any point, of any danger posed by the land reclaimers. \u00a0Yet the government took the extreme measure of gaining an <em>ex parte<\/em> injunction against the occupiers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>An Inquiry and a Killer Cop Convicted<\/p>\n<p>In a rare turn of events in the Canadian state context, where police are almost never charged or brought to trial for killing civilian, the officer who killed Dudley George, Acting Sergeant Ken \u201cTex\u201d Deane was actually charged and his case tried in a court of law. Deane put forward a defense that he believed Dudley George to be carrying a rifle at the time he shot the young man. The presiding judge did not accept this Defense and found Deane\u2019s claims to lack credibility, a rare conclusion regarding police officer testimony in cases where officers are charged for killing someone. According to Judge Hugh Fraser: \u201cI find, sir, that you were not honest in presenting this version of events to the Ontario Provincial Police investigators. You were not honest in presenting this version of events to the Special Investigations Unit of the Province of Ontario. You were not honest in maintaining this ruse before this court\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 198). Deane was found guilty of criminal negligence but sentenced to a non-custodial punishment. For killing Dudley George in cold blood Tex Deane was given a conditional sentence of two years less a day which was to be served in the community (Edwards 2001, 214).<\/p>\n<p>Despite the conviction, Tex Deane did not lose his job as a police officer. He maintained his employment with the force for five-and-a-half years following the criminal conviction. Over that time Officer Deane appealed his conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal and eventually all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. Finally, in the wake of a hearing under the Police Act, Deane was additionally convicted of Discreditable Conduct. He was given the option of resigning within seven days or being fired and left the force. Deane would go on to work as a security guard, unsettlingly, at an Ontario Hydro nuclear station.<\/p>\n<p>Tex Deane was killed in a car accident on February 25, 2006. Ironically perhaps, his vehicle collided with a truck near Prescott, Ontario while Deane was traveling to testify in the provincial inquiry called into the government handling of the Ipperwash crisis (Harris 2006).<\/p>\n<p>Following the police killing of Dudley George the George family made ongoing calls for both the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada to strike a public inquiry into the handling of the response to the land reclamation at Ipperwash by the province and the police. They wanted to know especially the nature and extent of government involvement in directing police operations against the Indigenous community protesters.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, on November 12, 2003, a public inquiry was launched in Ontario. This only happened after the ruling Conservative Party lost the election of 2003 to the Liberal Party headed by Dalton McGuinty. The Conservatives had held to power and refused an inquiry into their actions for eight years.<\/p>\n<p>While the inquiry was funded by the Government of Ontario it was carried out under a third party, Sidney B. Linden, who was deemed to be neutral. Linden derived his authority as a commissioner as covered by the Public Inquiries Act (Ontario). The public inquiry was given the specific mandate to examine and report on the events surrounding the killing of Dudley George. This was not a trial and no punishment would be levied. It was expected that the inquiry would provide recommendations covering interactions between police and Indigenous communities in future events of similar nature to the Ipperwash protests.<\/p>\n<p>Evidence provided over the course of the inquiry was damning of the Conservative government\u2019s racism and contempt for Indigenous communities. It also showed dubious government relationships with police and pointed to government pressures on policing in the nature of a police state. At one point a 17-minute tape recording was submitted that revealed a stunning conversation between OPP Inspector Ron Fox and Inspector John Carson, the OPP commander in charge of the Ipperwash case before Dudley George was killed. The two officers discussed Premier Mike Harris&#8217;s aggressive and racist perspective that that the government has \u201ctried to pacify and pander to these people far too long\u201d and to use \u201cswift affirmative action\u201d to remove the Indigenous people from the park (Ipperwash Inquiry 2007). It could be said that this was the only time in his period in office that Mike Harris supported any form of affirmative action.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps most damning was shocking evidence provided by former Ontario Provincial Attorney General Charles Harnick on November 28, 2005. Harniick testified that Premier Harris used extreme profanity while shouting, \u201cI want the fucking Indians out of my park\u201d (Ipperwash Public Inquiry 2005).<\/p>\n<p>Former Premier Mike Harris did appear reluctantly before the inquiry on February 14, 2006. Harris denied in his testimony that he had ever made the statement attributed to him by Harnick (CBC News 2006). Notably, Justice Linden \u201cfound the statements were made and they were racist, whether intended or not\u201d (Ipperwash Inquiry, Volume 1 2007, 677).<\/p>\n<p>The evidentiary hearings portion of the inquiry ended on June 28, 2006. The final report from Justice Linden and the overall findings of the inquiry were released on May 31, 2007 (CBC News 2007). They concluded that the Premier\u2019s office and the police had acted inappropriately and improperly in the events at Ipperwash.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Not in Vain: Victory to the Occupiers and the Return of the Lands<\/p>\n<p>The killing of Dudley George can only be considered a state atrocity, an extrajudicial execution carried out on behalf of a government that sought to show it was tough of protesters and, more, an upholder of the colonial power relations at the heart of the Canadian state. But Dudley George\u2019s death was not in vain. His people would emerge victorious in this particular struggle despite the efforts of the Ontario government. Unfortunately this victory, and confirmation of the rightness of their struggle, would only come 12 years after Dudley George was killed.<\/p>\n<p>On December 20, 2007, the Ontario Provincial government, now under Liberal Party direction, made a public announcement that it would finally return the full acreage of Ipperwash Provincial Park to its proper inhabitants, the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation (Gillespie 2007). This initial announcement did not make full return of the lands immediately since the land was placed under co-management by the provincial government and the Indigenous communities for an unspecified period of time. The government also announced that there would be consultations carried out with nearby local communities (non-Indigenous). Then-Aboriginal Affairs Minister Michael Bryant suggested that the land would be turned over to full Chippewa control at the end of this consultation process.<\/p>\n<p>The date finally came on Thursday May 28, 2009, when then-Ontario Aboriginal Affairs Minister Brad Duguid formally signed control of Ipperwash Park over to the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation (McCaffery 2009). The full settlement was only finalized on April 14, 2016, a delay for the community of more than 70 years after the government\u2019s promised return of the end of World War Two. The land was turned over to the community along with a\u00a0 payment of $95 million. The Federal government was represented in the signing over by Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan and Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Dr. Carolyn Bennett. Signing the agreement on behalf of the First Nation was Chief Thomas Bressette (Bridge 2016).<\/p>\n<p>It should also be noted that some members of the community have opposed the agreement as too little too late. Pierre George was engulfed in flames during a protest prior to the signing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>CODA: They are the Government. We Can Never Trust the Police<\/p>\n<p>Peter Edwards gives a sense of the hegemonic view of policing held by most media members, but which Indigenous communities hold with skepticism. According to the reporter:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a basic understanding in a democracy that police keep a professional distance from politicians It has to be this way. Otherwise, police would soon find themselves ordered to crack down on the political rivals of whoever is in office, ass happens in Third World police states. That would be the certain death of democracy.\u201d (Edwards 2001, 24)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Well then democracy in Canada is already dead. Killed by police. As each of the cases of activists killed by police in Canada shows the ruling politicians and political parties do not keep a distance from police. Regularly they engage with, direct, and\/or pressure police to act with violence <em>for political purposes<\/em> and <em>toward political ends<\/em>. The police killing of Dudley George was no different in this respect.<\/p>\n<p>One Indigenous woman offered an alternative view of the hegemonic perspective on [police as peacekeepers. In her view: \u201cThey [the police] are the government. We can never trust the police\u201d (quoted in Edwards 2001, 25). This is a clear sighted and correct criminological analysis of the historic and contemporary character of policing in Canada. Despite what the national mythologies might have one believe.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Bridge, Terry. 2016. \u201cFeds\u2019 1942 Land Expropriation Dispute Resolved with Land\u2019s Return and $95-Million Payment to Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation.\u201d <em>Sarnia Observer<\/em>.

Police Kill Samuel Maloney, 35-Year-Old Father of Two with Children in House","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/12\/27\/london-police-kill-samuel-maloney-35-year-old-father-of-two-with-children-in-house\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-6B","content":"<p>Police in London, Ontario killed Samuel Maloney, 35, early Friday morning around 6 AM, December 23, 2016, at his home on the city\u2019s Duchess Avenue. Police fired into the house and killed the victim while at least one child, including a toddler, was present inside. A woman, said to be living at the home, was reported immediately after the killing by police to be holding the toddler. Two children, the two-year-old boy and a six-month-old baby girl live in the house. Their father is now dead.<\/p>\n<p>The differential and deferential treatment given killer police by mass media compared to what is shown to the victims of police is exemplified in the headline used by the <em>National Post<\/em> newspaper in the case of this killing. The headline, \u201cLondon Cop Shot with a Crossbow During Confrontation that Led to Man Being Gunned Down by Police,\u201d focuses on harm supposedly incurred by an officer (an injury) rather than the killing of the civilian (who may have had nothing to do with the crossbow). In fact the national paper does not even give the victim the dignity of saying he was killed by police. Instead he was \u201cgunned down\u201d as if some undeserving villain in an old West drama. The stricken officer is even given first notice, and primary concern, in the first sentence in the article. Yet the officer\u2019s injuries are reported as only minor.<\/p>\n<p>The news accounts also focus on a previous weapons raid at the home in 2007, when Maloney was 26. This sets the stage to pose the victim as a legitimate target. Despite the fact that, as the report later reveals, Samuel Maloney was found to have all of his weapons properly registered. This image of a weapons hoarder in a Canadian context is explicitly meant to evoke the vision of some gun obsessed survivalist a la the US context of NRA extremists. Yet it is curious that someone with a supposedly massive weapons cache would use a crossbow rather than a gun if they sought to do real damage to police. Interestingly though it is the victim\u2019s partner Melissa Facciolo, 35, who is charged with possession of a prohibited weapon\u2014the crossbow.<\/p>\n<p>As in virtually every case in which police kill a civilian in Canada, the media turn focus directly to the history of the victim to legitimize whatever actions police might have taken. This case is no different in that regard. Yet there is nothing to suggest that the victim\u2019s weapons ownership is in any way related to violent or threatening or even seriously criminal behavior. And in any event, as in all such cases, random or trivial accounts of some aspect of personal history say nothing about a victim\u2019s activities in the moment in which police killed them.<\/p>\n<p>It has still not been independently confirmed that Maloney was the person who supposedly fired a cross bow striking an officer. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which investigates cases of harm to civilians by police officers in Ontario, has designated three subject officers as well as 18 witness officers in the case. Apparently no charge have been disclosed related to any reason police attended the house in the first place. In addition police refuse to say why they were at the home.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Carruthers Dale and Jennifer O\u2019Brien. 2016. \u201cLondon Cop Shot with a Crossbow During Confrontation that Led to Man Being Gunned Down by Police.\u201d <em>National Post<\/em>.

is rare for police who kill civilians in Canada to suffer any repercussions for their actions. They are almost never charged, for even lesser offenses let alone murder, and are generally not subject even to administrative discipline. Even more police who kill are provided with a number of pre-packaged excuses to let them off the hook when they kill. Among these are the myth of the dangerous job, excited delirium, and victim blaming. The latter is often used in cases where police kill someone experiencing addiction or mental health issues. Often inquests and coroner\u2019s inquiries replay these excuses in legitimizing the actions of killer police.<\/p>\n<p>A particularly offensive example of this can be found recently in the report released on Friday, December 9, by the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) in the case of RCMP officers who shot and killed a 47-year-old Morinville man in May of 2015. While not at all surprising that ASIRT found the RCMP officers to be justified in killing a civilian, it was rather stunning that ASIRT executive director Susan Hughson would victim blame by calling the victim \u201ca troubled man\u201d with \u201ca troubled history\u201d and focusing on his history of mental health issues. And the executive director took the step of issuing a statement to this effect.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Killing<\/p>\n<p>In the case of this killing RCMP were called to a home in the countryside by a family member who claimed that the man, who was prohibited from being on the property by court order was supposedly \u201cacting out of character\u201d (CBC News 2016). The family member claimed the victim might have stopped taking medication.<\/p>\n<p>Some time after 7:30 PM, four officers arrived at the home and undertook a search of the property looking for the man. After more than an hour the man was spotted in a field nearby, not on the property. Police may then have agitated the man by telling him he was under arrest. After yelling at the man he reportedly picked up two long rifles and turned an walked away from the police. Yes, according to the ASIRT report he walked away from, not toward, the police. Officers continued to use the language of arrest and surrender. At some point when the man turned around he was shot once by an officer, falling to the ground.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than assist the man officers waited for both air crews and an armored vehicle to arrive before going to \u201csecure the suspect\u201d (CBC News 2016). The man could not be revived and died at the scene. Notably he had been shot once in the abdomen and might have survived with earlier assistance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>OK to Kill a Troubled Man? An Ideology of Legitimation<\/p>\n<p>Notably the justification given by ASIRT for the police killing leaned very heavily on victim blaming and emphasizing the man\u2019s \u201clengthy and troubled history of significant mental illness\u201d (CBC News 2016). Executive director Hughson doubled down by also highlighting the victim\u2019s \u201cconflict with the law\u201d (CBC News 2016). According to the executive director\u2019s statement: \u201cHe had a documented history of psychotic and mood related behavioural issues and delusional thoughts for which his family had repeatedly sought help\u201d (CBC News 2016). Hughson\u2019s statement continued: \u201cWithin the preceding year, the man had previously made comments that he would not be able to handle going to jail, that he hated police, and that he had had suicidal thoughts. He was supposed to be under psychiatric care at the time of his death\u201d (CBC News 2016). Clearly the police emphasis that he was under arrest would have stoked any anxiety about a possible return to jail.<\/p>\n<p>But this background is purely justificatory. The history does not speak to the actions of police on that day in that place. It provides a screen behind which virtually any police action, at any time, in any context could be legitimized. In this case ASIRT executive director is saying that the victim\u2019s history allows for any and all actions taken by police against him. This is the ideology of legitimation that excuses police violence and killings of civilians.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>CBC News. 2016. \u201cA Troubled History: RCMP Justified in Shooting Death of Alberta Man, Investigation Concludes.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

One can go back at least to the quackery of Cesare Lombroso who used facial structures and other physical features to reinforces prejudices of the impoverished working class as the born criminal (which also served nicely to direct attention away from corporate or state crime). One of the most pernicious and insulting \u201cideas\u201d of phony criminology in recent years is the notion of so-called suicide by cop. This fake theory has been mostly promoted and peddled by cops and former cops posing as criminologists (and using this \u201cresearch\u201d to secure plum faculty positions in universities). It has been used largely to get killer cops off the hook in criminal proceedings and thus the suicide by cop specialists typically make their services available to police associations and defense teams trying to protect cops in the rare trials and inquiries that police who kill civilians are subjected to.<\/p>\n<p>In 2017 an inquest will be held into the police killing of 44-year-old Roy Thomas Bell in 2007 in Winnipeg. The bogus notion of suicide by cop will play a key part in this. In January, a standing hearing will be held to determine who will be allowed to participate in the inquest.<\/p>\n<p>Roy Thomas Bell was a former member of the\u00a0Canadian Armed Forces who was killed in December 2007 by police officers responding to a 911 call. Friends of the victim suggest that he had been dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder after having served in the military for over 20 years prior to his release from the forces in 2004.<\/p>\n<p>According to a provincial news release Bell threatened arriving officers with\u00a0 some form of weapon described as nothing more than two sticks connected by a chain (would be nunchucks). Police had erroneously claimed at the time of the killing that Bell had a firearm and a bat. This was not proven out. Still police tased the man before firing their handguns, with multiple shots hitting the victim. Bell was transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead.<\/p>\n<p>Witnesses at the time reportedly heard Bell say the officers should shoot him and this has given the police the in they needed to use the suicide by cop excuse. Never mind that the man only held basic nunchucks yet was shot seral times by police. Never mind too that someone asking the cops to shoot them would seem to pose little threat to them and would probably necessitate an alternative response. Any cop responding to such a request affirmatively should be seriously questioned.<\/p>\n<p>The inquest has been called by the chief medical examiner under the Fatality Inquiries Act and will examine the circumstances and events surrounding the killing. Such inquests typically make non-binding recommendations about measures to lessen the likelihood of such incidents in the future.<\/p>\n<p>There are real concerns here that phony criminologists will be allowed to participate and peddle their bogus suicide by cop obfuscations and legitimation. Thus such an inquiry can become an ideological tool to justify the killing by police in question as well as providing a precedent for justifying future killings on these nonsensical grounds.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Phony criminology has been used to provide justification and cover for authorities throughout the course of the discipline.

Police Kill Again: Woman is Fifth Civilian Killed in 2016","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/11\/30\/calgary-police-kill-again-woman-is-fifth-civilian-killed-in-2016\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-6q","content":"<p>Stop them before they kill again. Over the course of 2016 the Calgary police have been on a veritable killing spree. Only a week after they claimed their fourth victim (and ninth shooting) of the year, Terrence Weinmeyer (49), officers of the Calgary Police Service (CPS) killed again. This time the victim was a woman (said to be 27-years-old). With more than a month left in the year CPS officers have now shot 10 people and killed five. This is outrageous behavior even for police and suggests that this particular force, in a mid-sized city, is confident that members will face no consequences for use of extreme, lethal, violence. That the fifth victim of the killing rampage by Calgary Police Service is a woman is somewhat startling given that most civilian victims of police killings are male, predominantly so.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Executed for \u201cActing Erratically\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The woman was engaged by police in the early morning of Tuesday, November 29 in Sunalta around the 1700 block of 11the Avenue S.W. Police claim they were called to the neighborhood around 2:30 AM. At some point they claim they observed the victim banging on building doors and car windows. They claim she was acting erratically and for this it seems they took the action of killing her.<\/p>\n<p>In the view of one neighbor of the victim, Raine McLeod, the police clearly overreacted. According to McLeod:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was appalled and disgusted and absolutely shocked\u00a0that they would have to use that kind of force, or they would determine that kind of force was required. She was always really nice in the hallway. We knew each others\u2019 names. Our dogs liked each other. She was pleasant. She never seemed threatening or scary or anything like that. She seemed like a nice, normal girl.\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2016)<\/p>\n<p>An image of the supposed weapons said to be held by the victim show a poor facsimile of a broken steak knife and a bent piece of tin. Clearly these are not the \u201cweapons\u201d to panic a trained, professional as Chief Roger Chaffin would claim his officers to be.<\/p>\n<p>The Calgary force has taken to issuing and carrying out extrajudicial death sentences for very low level activities. And the threshold appears to be getting lower. Terrence Weinmeyer was executed for being in a possibly stolen vehicle. The woman killed on November 29 was executed for supposedly acting erratically. The executing officer has been on the force for one year. She has apparently been a quick learner.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Lacking Credibility<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly, the chief of the Calgary police, the by now rather notorious Roger Chaffin, once again jumped to conclusions and offered the by now ready-made, and unsubstantiated, pat answer to explain away and justify his force\u2019s seemingly murderous activities. Claimed Chaffin the fault lies not with an out of control force that has apparently gotten a taste for blood, but with general opioid use (in the city?; the province?; the country?). This has become too simple, and too simplistic. The chief cannot be taken seriously at this point. Not further that Chief Chaffin has offered public warnings, not so thinly veiled threats really, to whistleblowers within the force.<\/p>\n<p>His pat answer about social drug use cannot explain why someone banging on windows and doors would be shot and killed so quickly and without pursuit of alternatives by CPS officers. This really calls into question the basic capability, competence, and judgement of officers as well as the general mindset of the force more broadly.<\/p>\n<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the agency that examines killings of civilians in the province is investigating this most recent killing by Calgary police. ASIRT does not have a great record (or any record) of holding killer police in Alberta to any accountability for their actions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>CBC News. 2016. \u201cWoman Shot Dead by Calgary Police Was Armed with 2 Knives, Officials Say.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/calgary\/woman-shot-dead-police-sunalta-1.3872286\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/calgary\/woman-shot-dead-police-sunalta-1.3872286<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Stop them before they kill again.

Police Kill Fourth Civilian in 2016, Terrence Weinmeyer, (November 22,

police have become among the most deadly city forces in the country. The police war on drugs in Calgary has claimed yet another victim among these as a 49-year-old man, Terrence Weinmeyer, was shot and killed by police in a strip mall in the northwest part of the city on November 22, 2016. Weinmeyer is the fourth person killed and ninth person shot by Calgary police in 2016 alone. Weinmeyer\u2019s brother described his loved one as: \u201cHe was a very good man with a big heart. He was a good father\u201d (quoted in Grant 2016). Police tried to smear their victim by reporting his criminal record.<\/p>\n<p>Calgary police have killed an inordinate number of people over the last year in protecting motor vehicles against being stolen. Extrajudicial execution seems a steep penalty for theft. And while police claim to be restricted in what they can say about such killings they have not held back in linking supposed vehicle thefts to drugs. Specifically they have played on growing public fears over fentanyl to justify police actions and explain away police killings of civilians. Even when there is no independently confirmed link to fentanyl.<\/p>\n<p>This killing occurred, according to police, as officers in the break-and-enter unit were supposedly moving to make an arrest of someone in a vehicle. Police claim the vehicle reversed and police opened fire killing one person inside. Another person was apparently taken into custody, but no charges have been laid against her as of yet. The truck in question had been boxed in by police so it is not clear why police decided to shoot Weinmeyer when it seems the vehicle was not able to leave the scene. Witnesses reported having to swerve to avoid police and noted that they had been traumatized by police actions (Tucker 2016). The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the agency that investigates police killings of civilians, is investigating this case.<\/p>\n<p>Calgary police superintendent James Hardy claimed he could not provide any details of the incident and possible threats posed to the public because of the ASIRT investigation. Yet he felt that it was alright to attribute the victim\u2019s actions to opiate use, which should have been similarly subject to ASIRT conditions, and which was not independently confirmed at the time the statement was made publicly. According to Hardy (despite claims that he cannot provide details): \u201cAs you are well aware, in what seems to be a nightly occurrence, the high frequency of crimes like stolen vehicles gives rise to serious officer and public safety concerns. You have these stolen vehicles and when these individuals are on opiates, they press hard\u201d (quoted in Anderson 2016). Yet there is nothing in this case to suggest the public faced any direct safety concerns.<\/p>\n<p>The contradiction in police speaking while saying they could not speak was hinted at by ASIRT executive director Susan Hughson. She acknowledged: \u201cFrom time to time there may be a disagreement from CPS (Calgary Police Service) needs compared to our needs\u201d (quoted in Grant 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Clearly this was an opportunistic statement from Calgary police provided first to justify the killing by police, and secondly to stoke public fears and prejudices in a manner favorable to police drug war activities.<\/p>\n<p>Violence by Calgary Police Service officers has kept ASIRT busy the last two years. In 2015 they had 78 files which represented a 100 percent increase over what had been the recorded average over the period 2008 to 2013. In 2016, with a month left in the year, they are at 74 files (Tucker 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Anderson, Drew. 2016. \u201cMan Shot Dead by Calgary Police Investigating Suspected Drug-Related Truck Theft.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

Edmonton","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/11\/23\/dubious-diagnosis-phony-excited-delirium-findings-get-killer-cops-off-in-burnaby-and-edmonton\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-6j","content":"<p>Police agencies and their ideological supporters, often located in criminology and psychology departments in universities and colleges, have developed entire cottage industries producing pseudo-science and pseudo-forensics, phony analyses, concepts, and terms, to justify and excuse police killings of civilians. These pseudo-scientific projects have constructed their own literatures, bodies of ideas, and \u201cexpert\u201d witnesses supporting dubious \u201cdiagnoses\u201d used to \u201cexplain\u201d how it is that victims of police violence came to be responsible (biologically or psychologically) for their own murders.<\/p>\n<p>Among the most pernicious and extensively developed and deployed of these pseudo-scientific diagnoses are the notorious notions of excited delirium and so-called suicide by cop. Neither of these has any scientific basis or legitimate supporting evidence to back them. They offer little, in fact, beyond the statements of police \u201cresearchers\u201d (cops and former cops who have used such work not only to support their colleagues and former colleagues but to claim positions in academia) and some compliant criminologists and psychologists and others supportive of police on ideological or opportunistic grounds (i.e. funding).<\/p>\n<p>While the dubious claim of excited delirium has no psychological or medical basis it is routinely used to let police officers walk away from any accountability when they kill civilians. Despite the recognition that excited delirium has no basis in scientific, psychological or medical, reality, it is still used in investigative cases on police killings, often by coroners\u2019 offices in the Canadian context, for example.<\/p>\n<p>In Canada the excited delirium excuse was used to let killer cops off the hook in two cases within a three week period over October and November of 2016. These cases involved the police killing of Maurizio Facchin (50) in Burnaby, British Columbia, in 2014 and Simon Chung (34) in Edmonton, Alberta, in 2013. Both cases involved the use of tasers by police and the men went into fatal distress only after a taser was used on them. Chung was also subjected to attempts by two Edmonton police to restrain him forcefully. He was tased twice by an officer while restrained, including one blast that lasted 28 seconds (Parsons 2016). In both cases the role of the taser in the men\u2019s deaths was acknowledged yet both deaths were ruled accidental.<\/p>\n<p>Notably in the case of the police killing of Simon Chung one of the officers claimed to suspect that the victim was experiencing excited delirium yet chose to restrain and taser him anyway. This would suggest culpability in his death given the claims of police that excited delirium could lead to a fatal response to either restraint or tasing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Dubious Diagnosis of Excited Delirium<\/p>\n<p>Excited delirium has come under growing public scrutiny in recent years given the overwhelming proportion of diagnoses related to deaths involving police use of compliance holds and\/or use of tasers. Typically these diagnoses are provided only by medical examiners not by hospital or emergency room doctors. Furthermore, and as alarming, there is the fact that excited delirium is presently not a recognized medical or psychiatric diagnosis by either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IVTR) of the American Psychiatric Association or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) of the World Health Organization. Due to these troubling facts, it is widely considered that the real cause of death in cases identified after the fact as instances of excited delirium are actually caused by straightforward police violence and use if force. These are related to taser use and positional asphyxia.<\/p>\n<p>Civil rights groups have argued that diagnoses of excited delirium are only applied after the fact to get police officers off the hook in cases in which excessive force has resulted in the death of a civilian. The NAACP reported in 2003 that excited delirium diagnoses are provided more often in explaining the deaths of minorities than they are in the deaths of white victims. In 2007, Eric Balaban of the American Civil Liberties Union noted that excited delirium was not recognized by the American Medical Association or the American Psychological Association and that the diagnosis simply served \u201cas a means of white-washing what may be excessive use of force and inappropriate use of control techniques by officers during an arrest\u201d (NPR 2007). Melissa Smith of the American Medical Association confirmed in 2007 that the association had \u201cno official policy\u201d on the supposed condition (ABC News 2007).<\/p>\n<p>Excited delirium is not recognized in Australia by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, the Australian Medical Association or any other registered medical body. Neither is it recognized in law. A 2015 case, in which a man who had been declared to have died from excited delirium was overturned by a ruling in the Victorian Coroners Court. The presiding coroner in that case concluded that neither excited delirium nor so called excited delirium syndrome are appropriate or helpful in providing a legitimate medical cause of death (Coroner\u2019s Court of Victoria at Melbourne 2015).<\/p>\n<p>The Burnaby ruling in the Mauricio Facchin case is particularly stunning, and disappointing, given that Vancouver was site of the 2007 police killing of migrant Robert Dziekanski whose death police initially lied about publicly suggesting he suffered excited delirium. Video by a civilian witness showed this claim to be untrue as Dziekanski was following police instructions when he was tased and jumped by police causing his death. During the inquiry into police actions that police psychologist Mike Webster that police have been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d by Taser International to justify \u201cridiculously inappropriate\u201d use of the weapon. Webster referred to excited delirium as a \u201cdubious disorder\u201d pushed by Taser International during its police training (Hall 2008). A 2008 report on taser use by the RCMP, <em>An Independent Review of the Adoption and Use of Conducted Energy Weapons by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police<\/em>, concluded that excited delirium should not be included in the operational manual for the Mounties in the absence of formal approval following consultation with a mental-health-policy advisory body (Kiedrowski 2008). Justice Thomas Braidwood concluded the inquiry finding that excited delirium should not be used as part of police use of force training as it is not a legitimate medical condition.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Recommendations Based On What?<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the coroner\u2019s inquiry into the police killing of Maurizio Facchin, the coroner\u2019s jury suggested that police receive training in identifying and properly responding to instances of excited delirium. It was also recommended that 911 dispatchers receive such training so that they might identify and inform police of potential excited delirium cases upon dispatch. Finally the jury suggested that officers contact emergency services when a taser is going to be deployed in such cases.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the police killing of Simon Chung, Provincial Court Judge Lloyd Malin provided two recommendations. In the first he suggested that while Edmonton Police Service mentions excited delirium syndrome in its policy and procedure manual on use of force, officers should also be trained to recognize the symptoms in all situations, not only during arrests. Malin also recommended that officers be trained to call for emergency medical services as soon as excited delirium is suspected. This call should be made regardless of the need for police to restrain an individual (Parsons 2016).<\/p>\n<p>These recommendations are based on the dubious diagnosis of excited delirium and will do little to change police behavior, particularly violent behavior. They will not address police killings of civilians. The recommendations are based on treatment of a social fiction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Note<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The notion of suicide-by-cop was first used in the early 1980s by a former California police officer working toward a PhD in Psychology. Virtually all of the research on the issue has been prepared by people with connections to police departments.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>ABC News. 2007. \u201cExcited Delirium: Police Brutality vs. Sheer Insanity.\u201d ABC News.

is little expectation that officers who kill civilians in Canada will be in any way held accountable (even minimally). This expectation is even further diminished in cases in which police have killed social activists in the course of upholding or defending the state capitalist status quo. Clearly in such cases the officers are carrying out their fundamental purpose of maintaining dominant structures of social stratification and hegemonic order. And in this they must be assured full protection and legitimation. Thus it is almost certain that they will not be taken to task under such circumstances for killing someone who challenges that order or threatens to make a public show of reasonable opposition to established order.<\/p>\n<p>The official investigation into the RCMP officers who killed Indigenous Anonymous activist James McIntyre while he was protesting the Site C dam megaproject in British Columbia and the conclusions drawn by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) is in no way surprising then. The IIO exonerated the officers involved including the cop who fired the shot that killed James McIntyre despite the fact that the officer failed even to file an internal report on the killing which is required under law. The IIO could only state with futility:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs of the time this decision is being issued, it does not appear that the subject officer has completed any reports or notes of his recollection of the incident. The IIO has, and continues to engage with the RCMP on the necessity of officers completing timely reports.\u201d (IIO 2016)<\/p>\n<p>Adds the IIO spokesperson Marten Youssef: \u201cThey are required to write timely reports, timely accounts, detailing their account of what happened. It appears as of the time of writing this case that the subject officer in this investigation did not comply with that policy.\u201d (quoted in Kurjata 2016)<\/p>\n<p>And there is nothing to suggest that the killer cop received so much as a stern word or cross look for this violation, let alone any sort of actual punishment. Yet the IIO concludes that the officer did nothing wrong despite the absence of any report.<\/p>\n<p>The failure of officers involved in the killing of civilians to file reports of to file reports in a timely manner is notorious in British Columbia, a fact the IIO has raised repeatedly. Indeed officers often watch media coverage before filing a report in those cases where a report is actually provided. Clearly police in the province view the legal requirements under which they are supposed to operate as something of a joke or at most a matter of personal convenience rather than a legal requirement of their job. As in other cases the officers view themselves as above the law\u2014they are a law unto themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore there is no mechanism to compel officers to interview with the IIO in the course of its investigation. That is, officers choose whether or not they will interview with the supposedly independent investigation. One can well guess the choice killer cops tend to make. So in the case of the RCMP killing of James McIntyre the IIO had no interview testimony from the officer responsible for killing McIntyre.<\/p>\n<p>Notably witnesses interviewed by the IIO varied in their accounts of how James McIntyre responded to police (approached, lunged, jabbing, coming towards, etc.). They were inconsistent in portraying the threat, if any, that the victim posed. There is no sense that James McIntyre posed a threat beyond police to the public. In addition the witnesses do make clear that James McIntyre was shot almost immediately as police told him to drop his knife (which some witnesses suggested was described as a \u201cweapon\u201d rather than a knife by police). Some witnesses noted having unreliable sight lines. One witness noted not being able to see after being hit by pepper spray from police (and before the fatal shot was fired). A witness officer admits that McIntyre only became agitated <em>after<\/em> being pepper sprayed. Yet the IIO somehow concluded that the officers did nothing to provoke McIntyre. Despite all of this the IIO wrapped their investigation and exonerated the officer, who remains unnamed.<\/p>\n<p>Police did not even know until afterwards that McIntyre was not the man they had received a call about a protester at an event promoting the Site C project. That man was local farmer Terry Hadland. Hadland described his reasons for ripping up maps and turning over tables at the event: \u201cI triggered the whole darn thing because I didn\u2019t want Hydro to get away with smooching up to the public\u201d (quoted in Kurjata 2016). He was deeply impacted by the police actions that killed James McIntyre. In his words:\u00a0 \u201cOh, I was devastated. I felt awfully guilty. I could hardly believe that\u2026it was surreal, especially as I began to realize it was me they were out for\u201d (quoted in Kurjata 2016).<\/p>\n<p>It remains to be seen what response Anonymous might have to the conclusion of the IIO investigation. The <em>National Post<\/em> reports their interview with an Anonymous activist previously. The activist is quoted as saying there would be retaliation in the event of a cover up:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur message to whoever will be making those kind of decisions (is) that we are a very talented and patient and courageous crew and even if it takes us many months or many years to figure out what went wrong, we will sniff out your dirtiest laundry, procure it from wherever it\u2019s hiding and find the highest flagpole in the windiest part of the public square and hang it up for everyone to smell and everyone to see.\u201d (quoted in Humphreys 2016)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If not a cover up, the IIO investigation certainly leaves important questions unanswered. While raising many others.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Humphreys, Adrian. 2016. \u201cRCMP Officer Cleared in Shooting Death of B.C.

Officers Who Killed Felix Taqqaugaq Identified as Constable Jason Trites (Shooter) and Sergeant Peter Marshall

is rare in the Canadian context that police officers who kill civilians are ever named publicly. This generally only happens in the few cases that result in charges laid against police or in case of a public inquiry or inquest. With the coroner\u2019s inquest onto the police killing of Felix Taqqaugaq on March 20, 2012, mandatory in cases of police harm to civilians in Nunavut, the RCMP officers who killed him have been identified publicly as Constable Jason Trites and Sergeant Peter Marshall.<\/p>\n<p>Constable Trites knew that Taqqaugaq was dealing with mental health issues, which the officer understood to be schizophrenia, yet he still moved quickly to arrest the man for supposedly uttering threats and fired a taser at him only moments into the encounter (and before the man had done anything more than speak to officers). The taser fire may have upset Taqqaugaq who was then chased back into his house by Sergeant Marshall. In response to this police chase Taqqaugaq may have returned brandishing a knife.<\/p>\n<p>By Trite\u2019s own admission he tripped (apparently in a panic) while backing away from Taqqaugaq and firing his handgun. This left Trites with a self-inflicted wound to his hand. This injury was initially reported publicly but it was not clarified that Trites had shot himself. Such early reports of officer injuries, without the information that the injuries are self-inflicted, can give the impression that police were physically threatened or harmed and thus justified in using lethal force. A similarly deceptive mention of injury to an officer (that later was identified as officer-inflicted) was given in the RCMP killing of Hudson Brooks in Surrey, British Columbia. While on his back Trites shot Taqqaugaq three times. The man was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.<\/p>\n<p>According to Mary Ijjangiaq, Taqqaugaq\u2019s partner of 13 years the police instigated the situation that led to the killing. In her words to the inquest: \u201cThey ganged up on him. He was deliberately provoked. I think [the officer] deliberately made sure he died\u201d (quoted in Murray 2016a). She says the victim held a knife at his chest not over his head in a threatening manner as police claim.<\/p>\n<p>Police audio from the incident raise further questions and ppint to a very quick escalation to lethal force by police. From the moment that officers radioed in to the Iqaluit command centre reporting they had located the suspect only 60 seconds passed before one officer called out \u201cShots fired; suspect down\u201d (Murray 2016a).<\/p>\n<p>As cops typically do in such cases officer Trites has attempted to present himself as the victim requiring sympathy. In his pitch to the inquiry he attempts to make the family feel sorry for himself: \u201cI just hope the family knows that they\u2019re not the only ones that were hurt by this. The things that I deal with, do affect my personal life. I\u2019m definitely not the same person as I used to be before this incident\u201d (quoted in Murray 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly both Constable Trites and Sergeant Marshall were flown out of the northern community (where the RCMP is a still colonial force) the very next day after the killing of Felix Taqqaugaq. Trites has testified at the inquest by video from Halifax.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Murray, Nick. 2016a. \u201c\u2018They Ganged Up on Him\u2019: Wife of Igloolik Man Killed by Police Heard Shots Fired.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/north\/felix-taqqaugaq-inquest-wife-witness-testimony-1.3842011\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/north\/felix-taqqaugaq-inquest-wife-witness-testimony-1.3842011<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Murray, Nick. 2016b. \u201c\u2018I Was Trying to Stop Him\u2019: RCMP Officer Apologizes for Shooting Felix Taqqaugaq.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

police chase in downtown Brantford, Ontario, on Monday, November 7, 2016, ended in a the death of a 94-year-old woman after a car being chased by police crashed into the vehicle in which she was a passenger. The victim was taken to Brantford General Hospital where she was pronounced dead. The driver of her vehicle sustained numerous fractures. According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) which investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, the chase started as police attempted to stop a vehicle beginning around 10:30 AM. The crash occurred at 10:40 AM.<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly this crash occurred at the intersection of Colborne Street West and Gilkison Street, the same intersection at which a police car chase ended with the death of an innocent third party. On October 10, 2014, Ashley Lerno, 18, of Brantford, was killed as a result of a police chase when the vehicle she was driving was hit by another vehicle driven by Richard Gamble, 50, who was being chased by Brant County OPP (Ontario Provincial Police) officers for trying to avoid a RIDE, drinking and driving, check. The two officers in that case, Constable Craig McMurtrie and Constable Rod Grubb, have been charged, in a situation rarely faced by police whose actions result in deaths to civilians, with criminal negligence causing death. Their trial is slated to start on March 20, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>Once again it must be asked for how long such actions by police in pursuit of issues like this that result in deaths of innocent and uninvolved people will be tolerated. These are too frequent results of police chases for matters of less grave significance.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>A police chase in downtown Brantford, Ontario, on Monday, November 7, 2016, ended in a the death of a 94-year-old woman after a car being chased by police crashed into the vehicle in which she was a passenger.

Serious Questions over Police Role in Death of Jordan Lafond (Indigenous Victims)","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/11\/06\/fatally-injured-but-resisted-arrest-serious-questions-over-police-role-in-death-of-jordan-lafond-indigenous-victims\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-66","content":"<p>Jordan Bruce Lafond, a 21-year-old father of a small child, died one day after being taken into custody by Saskatoon police following a violent arrest on October 23, 2016. Several weeks later serious questions remain unanswered regarding the role of police violence in causing the young man\u2019s death.<\/p>\n<p>Jordan Lafond\u2019s mother, Charmaine Dreaver is seeking answers to those questions in the face of general silence from Saskatoon police. In her words: \u201cI just want and need the truth to be told,\u201d (quoted in Markewich 2016). Family members have turned to the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations special investigations unit and the Chief of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation to discuss possible steps forward.<\/p>\n<p>Jordan Lafond was the passenger in a vehicle that crashed while being chased by police. The driver sustained minimal injuries and ran from the scene. He was later found and charged. Lafond was supposedly found beneath the rear of the vehicle. Police have claimed he was thrown from the vehicle during the crash and was not run over by any vehicle. .<\/p>\n<p>Charmaine Dreaver notes her son showed real physical trauma. In her words: \u201cMy son was banged up pretty bad. His body showed signs of a lot of damage\u201d (quoted in Markewich 2016). She has reported being left with a sense of unease and questioning since learning about her son\u2019s injuries. This sense grew upon hearing that the other man in the vehicle who fled was not nearly as badly injured (Markewich 2016). As she recalls: \u201c[That] made me feel that, OK, there\u2019s something more to this\u201d (quoted in Markewich 2016). Police have said that the injuries, including bruising and head trauma were caused by the collision (Markewich 2016). She asked immediately for an autopsy to be undertaken to receive some answers and clarification. She relates: \u201cI was angered and I was so hurt because my son went through so much pain\u201d (quoted in Markewich 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Police have provided the questionable and apparently contradictory explanation that the supposedly fatally injured Lafond resisted arrest to such an extent that an officer felt compelled to use a knee to subdue him. This seems implausible given the supposed degree of injuries police suggest were sustained from the crash alone.<\/p>\n<p>Dreaver finds the explanation questionable as well. She notes: \u201cI almost felt that I was lied to, really, because I didn\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t told about [it]\u201d (quoted in Markewich 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The autopsy was completed Wednesday, November 2 but results have not been released. Saskatoon Police Chief Clive Weighill has not given the public a timeline for release of the autopsy findings.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Markewich, Courtney. 2016. \u201c\u2018Something More to This\u2019: Saskatoon Mother Seeks Answers in Death of Son Taken into Custody.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.
