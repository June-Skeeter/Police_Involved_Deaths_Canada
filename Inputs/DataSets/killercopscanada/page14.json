Police in the small northern Ontario city shot and killed Joey Knapaysweet, 21, on Saturday, February 3, 2018. Then, on Sunday, February 4, Agnes Sutherland, 62, died in police custody. Both victims were from Fort Albany First Nation, a James Bay community.<\/p>\n<p>Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents nearly 50 Indigenous communities in northern Ontario, expressed great concern over the two deaths in two days. In his words: \u201cIt\u2019s very troubling. The families have a lot of questions\u201d (quoted in Perkel 2018).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Deaths at the Hands of Police<\/p>\n<p>Details about both deaths are limited so far. Police control information about their killings and deaths related to their activities. This is a problem across Canada in terms of policing. Police did not release the names of their victims. The names were conformed by multiple other sources, including federal Member of Parliament Charlie Angus.<\/p>\n<p>With regard to the police shooting of Joey Knapaysweet, the province\u2019s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has only said that \u00a0there was \u201can interaction\u201d between officers and the victim and an officer discharged a firearm striking the man.<\/p>\n<p>Agnes Sutherland was arrested at a shelter after having been asked to leave the Timmins District Hospital, where she had sought help. She was taken to a police station and put in a cell on Saturday, the same day Knapaysweet was killed. Later that same evening she was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead late Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement issued by Indigenous leaders Grand Chief Fiddler, Grand Chief Jonathan Solomon of the Mushkegowuk Council, and Fort Albany First Nation Chief Andrew Solomon, serious questions are raised: \u201cIt is alleged that when police attended at the scene of the local shelter, Ms. Sutherland was treated roughly while being taken into police custody. She suffered severe complications during her detention\u201d (quoted in Perkel 2018).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Systemic Racism and Colonial Legacies<\/p>\n<p>In their statement, Grand Chief Fiddler, Grand Chief Solomon and Chief Andrew Solomon call for a timely and thorough investigation. They raise the very real issues of racism in policing and the violence targeted at Indigenous people by police. In their words: \u201cWe have seen systemic racism in the city of Thunder Bay, and must now wonder if this is also happening in Timmins\u201d (quoted in Perkel 2018).<\/p>\n<p>Notably, Timmins Mayor Steve Black acknowledged that the deaths at the hands of police had increased racial tensions in the city, though he did not specify. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s room for racism in any community. If changes need to be made or things need to be done to improve those relationships, we\u2019re definitely willing to work with our partners on improving those relationships\u201d (quoted in Perkel 2018). No word on whether that includes dismantling settler colonial police forces (or mayoralties). He has, though, condemned people who have spoken out against the police and their actions on social media (CBC News 2018).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Health Care Not Cops<\/p>\n<p>According to the Chiefs, both victims had left the remote community of Fort Albany, near Ontario\u2019s James Bay coast, to seek medical care in Timmins. They note in their statement: \u201cOur people must continually leave their families and communities to come to cities to seek services that are not available in their respective communities\u201d (quoted in 2018). The deaths come as an emergency summit is being held in Timmins by the Mushkegowuk Council this week. The regional James Bay government declared a state of emergency in November, concerned over the growing number of drugs and alcohol coming into its seven member communities (CBC News 2018).<\/p>\n<p>Sutherland\u2019s son, Glen Sutherland, told the <em>Timmins Daily Press<\/em> that his mother was a survivor of the notorious St. Anne\u2019s residential school. He said that she needed a wheelchair to get around, and questioned the actions of hospital staff. She was using a wheelchair at the time of her arrest. Glen Sutherland said that her frequent trips to the emergency room were a cry for help (Perkel 2018). She was a mother of six with six great grandchildren.<\/p>\n<p>The mistreatment at hospitals of Indigenous people seeking medical assistance has been a disturbing, and too common, issue in various locations in Canada, including infamous cases in Winnipeg, Manitoba that have gained some national attention. It speaks to ongoing legacies of colonialism and racism in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>A vigil in Timmins for Knapaysweet on Tuesday, February 6, drew around 100 people. Chief Andrew Solomon is calling on the Attorney General of Ontario and the Minister of Community Safety to investigate the Timmins Police (CBC News 2018).<\/p>\n<p>Police and criminal justice systems more broadly in Canada disproportionately target Indigenous people and disproportionately target them for violence. Criminal justice systems, including police forces, were founded as instruments of settler colonialism, occupation, dispossession, and displacement and this must always be front and center in discussions of policing in the country.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>CBC News. 2018. \u201cFirst Nations Chiefs \u2018Shocked\u2019 by Timmins Deaths.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

Video of Pierre Coriolan\u2019s Killing by Montreal Police Released as Family Sues City","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2018\/02\/07\/shocking-video-of-pierre-coriolans-killing-by-montreal-police-released-as-family-sues-city\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-gP","content":"<p>We have written extensively on the lack of proper public reporting of police killings of civilians in Canada, the fact that police control the flow of information and what is released publicly, and the lack of truly independent and autonomous oversight of police in Canada. Not all provinces in Canada have oversight agencies at all to investigate cases of police harm to civilians and those that exist are not truly independent or autonomous. Some, like the Bureau des enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendantes (BEI) in Quebec rely on active police force members for investigations.<\/p>\n<p>These facts were put fully, and painfully and violently, on display on Wednesday, February 7, 2018, as the family of Montreal police shooting victim Pierre Coriolan announced that they are suing the City of Montreal over the \u201cbrutal and excessive\u201d police intervention in which their loved one was killed by officer on June 27, 2017. The family also released a horrific video \u00a0of the police killing taken by a neighbor on a cellphone and passed to the family recently. It shows Coriolan being shot approximately 45 seconds into the police intervention. Lawyers for the Coriolan family suggest that the entire direct encounter lasted about one minute and ten seconds, during which time multiple weapons were used against the victim, including after he had been shot by police and was on the ground.<\/p>\n<p>Pierre, Coriolan, a 58-year-old Black immigrant from Haiti, was shot and killed by in the hallway outside his apartment after police reportedly responded to calls about a man yelling and smashing things inside his apartment on Robillard Avenue near St-Andr\u00e9 Street, in the city\u2019s gay village.<\/p>\n<p>The killing again raises issues of police violence, poverty, racism, and mental health issues. In addition, there have been concerns about the information provided publicly by police and the BEI regarding the killings of civilians by police.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Video<\/p>\n<p>The four minute cellphone video, recorded by the neighbor, an eyewitness to the killing, shows a chaotic scene in the hallway of the apartment building. Officers apparently use plastic bullets, a taser, and their firearms against Coriolan. He was allegedly holding some object, variously described as a screwdriver or a knife.<\/p>\n<p>The BEI have reported in a statement released at the time of the shooting that police first received 911 calls about Coriolan making noise in his apartment at about 7 PM. The cellphone video begins at 7:30 PM. It is not certain from the video how long officers had been on the scene at that point or what their engagement with Coriolan involved up to that point.<\/p>\n<p>The first five seconds of the video are audio only, without recorded video images. The audio records what is believed to be a gun firing a plastic bullet, followed by the crackling sound of a taser having been fired. Five officers then become visible with weapons drawn. They are crowded into the hallway, their backs to the camera. Other officers off-camera can be heard yelling from around a corner in the hallway.<\/p>\n<p>Pierre Coriolan comes into view eight seconds into the video. He appears to exit his apartment and walk toward the officers. Very soon after he moves from his apartment two or three gunshots are heard, but the image is obscured as the neighbor with the camera ducks somewhat into his apartment. When the camera focuses back on the hallway, an officer is heard yelling, \u201c\u00c0 terre! (Hit the ground!).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Coriolan is in view, on his knees, with four officers visible, and still pointing weapons at him. The victim is heard telling the officers, in French, \u201cPas capable (I can&#8217;t).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At that point, one of the officers is heard, incredibly, asking a colleague in French, \u201cDo you have another shot?\u201d After an unintelligible response, the officer yells, \u201cTake the other shot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At that point, two shots ring out. It is not clear what has been fired, plastic bullets or live ammunition.<\/p>\n<p>In response to the gunshots, Pierre Coriolan collapses fully on the ground. Only his legs are visible in the frame. Only then is an officer heard to yell, \u201cKnife.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A first officer approaches Coriolan and kneeling beside him, appears to search for a weapon, rather than offering any medical care or attention. Shockingly, another officer then approaches Coriolan, extends a telescopic baton, and swings it twice with heavy force toward the victim\u2019s arm. Coriolan is heard to grunt in pain.<\/p>\n<p>Officers lower their weapons, and one is heard speaking into his radio to say, \u201cA man, possibly injured by gunshot.\u201d Clearly they knew he had been hit and injured.<\/p>\n<p>The officers are standing talking to each other calmly. One says, \u201cIt\u2019s a screwdriver he had.\u201d Another officer says, \u201cNo, it was a knife.\u201d Only then are officers heard saying, \u201cHe\u2019s injured. He\u2019s hit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Coriolan\u2019s legs can be seen convulsing as one officer says the stricken man is still breathing. Another officer responds saying, \u201cNo, he\u2019s not breathing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The video ends when an officer demands that witnesses in the hallway get back into their apartments. Pierre Coriolan would be pronounced dead later that evening in hospital.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Disturbing Actions Leave Disturbing Questions<\/p>\n<p>Pierre Coriolan\u2019s killing was met with protests and calls for action by community activists and organizers, including Black Lives Matter organizers. Community activists Will Prosper and Maguy M\u00e9tellus joined the family\u2019s lawyers and Joanne Coriolan, the victim\u2019s niece at the press conference releasing the video and announcing the family lawsuit. The lawsuit was launched by two of Coriolan\u2019s sisters who were not present at the news conference. They are seeking a total of $163,426 in damages.<\/p>\n<p>Prosper, a former RCMP officer, expressed shock and disbelief upon first viewing the video. In his words: \u201cThe first question I asked myself is, \u2018Why don\u2019t you take the time?\u2019 There&#8217;s no rush\u201d (quoted Rukavina in 2018).<\/p>\n<p>Prosper raised the question on everyone\u2019s mind since the killing last year, which is why a man was shot and killed for making noise in his own apartment. As Prosper points out: \u201dThe only thing Pierre was threatening was his own apartment. He was not a threat to anybody else\u201d (quoted in Rukavina 2018).<\/p>\n<p>Prosper was even more stark in his questioning of why a kneeling man was viewed as such a threat. He asks: \u201cWhat is the threat of a black man kneeling down? It\u2019s a firing squad he\u2019s facing\u201d (quoted in Rukavina 2018).<\/p>\n<p>The only time on the video recording that police even directly speak to Coriolan is when they order him to the ground <em>after<\/em> he has already been shot. Says Propser: \u201cYou see there\u2019s no communication, nothing mentioned to him as he&#8217;s kneeling down\u201d (quoted in Rukavina 2018). After the man has been shot and is on the ground police do not even ask after his condition. Instead they hit him with a telescopic baton.<\/p>\n<p>Alain Arsenault, a member of the family\u2019s legal team, said that they have little faith in the BEI investigation and that said a lawsuit is the best available avenue to obtain justice for Coriolan. It may be the only way that the public can find out any meaningful information about the actions of police.<\/p>\n<p>Arsenault said that the decision to release the video was prompted partly by frustration over the slow pace of the investigation and the oversight agency\u2019s refusal to provide updates to the family. These are repeated concerns expressed by family members of people killed by police across Canada.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The video can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/news.google.com\/news\/video\/ow10u5_zod4\/dDnbIQ6E5KSZOqMJZ2vQh0aMMunjM?hl=en&#038;gl=US&#038;ned=us\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/news.google.com\/news\/video\/ow10u5_zod4\/dDnbIQ6E5KSZOqMJZ2vQh0aMMunjM?hl=en&#038;gl=US&#038;ned=us<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Rukavina, Steve. 2018. \u201cFamily of Montreal Man Fatally Shot by Police Sues Over \u201cBrutal Intervention.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

Saidi was shot and killed by Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) outside their Morrisburg detachment only minutes after his father dropped him off for a scheduled probation check-in on December 23, 2017. While little has been reported publicly about the details of the killing, as it rarely is in cases of police killings in Canada, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has designates a lone subject officer in their investigation. This means they believe that a sole officer fired the shot(s) that struck and killed Babak Saidi that day. As is unfortunately the standard practice in Canada the officer responsible for the killing has not been identified publicly. Saidi\u2019s killing is being investigated by the provincial police watchdog, the Special Investigations Unit, which has assigned four investigators and three forensic specialists to the case.<\/p>\n<p>The 43-year-old Saidi, whose was born in Iran but came to Canada as a refugee with his family, had been diagnosed with late onset schizophrenia and social paranoia according to his family. They are looking for answers and for mechanisms to address the ongoing use of violence by police toward people experiencing mental health issues.<\/p>\n<p>In the words of Babak Saidi\u2019s sister, Elly Saidi: \u00a0\u201cThis is yet another shocking example of a lethal police response to an unarmed person with mental health disabilities. I want everyone to learn from this tragic experience\u201d (quoted in Duffy 2018).<\/p>\n<p>Babak Saidi had gone to the same OPP station more than 30 times \u2014 every week for nine months \u2014 in 2017. Elly Saidi says that the family remains very much in the dark about why his routine check-in at the police station so quickly turned deadly. In her words \u201cIt would be good to get an explanation for what happened. I don\u2019t know what instigated it: Why this time was so different than every other time?\u201d (quoted in Duffy 2018).<\/p>\n<p>Saidi\u2019s father, Mehrab Saidi (83), has reported hearing \u201cmultiple gunshots\u201d while in his car, moments after dropping off his son at the detachment. He has also said that he was instructed by police to wait at a nearby coffee shop for more information and was only notified of his sons death hours later.<\/p>\n<p>Elly Saidi is chief executive of United World Voices, a registered charity in Ottawa that works with homeless youth and vulnerable women. She says her brother was only diagnosed with schizophrenia early in 2017 as the family had not been able to get a diagnosis for him. In her words: \u201cWe told lawyers for many years he needs help. Like a lot of people in his position, they fall through the cracks. He should have been assessed and treated much earlier. We knew there was something wrong with him, but it was hard to get anyone to listen. That\u2019s the frustrating part\u201d (quoted in Duffy 2018).<\/p>\n<p>In the view of Elly Saidi her brother should not have died in the encounter:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is beyond doubt is that OPP members involved in this tragedy were unable to peacefully de-escalate this situation. The OPP resorted to a lethal response to an unarmed individual with mental disabilities. I know that things can escalate from zero to 100 in a few seconds with mentally ill people. The police need to know how to deal with that, how to de-escalate and contain the situation.\u201d (quoted in Duffy 2018)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, Babak Saidi had publicly reported feeling harassed by local police in Brockville, Ontario, where he lived. During a 2003 court hearing, Saidi, then 29, told a judge that police in Brockville \u201chave been on my ass for 10 years\u201d (quoted in Duffy 2018). He continued, telling Ontario Court Justice Charles Anderson : \u201cThey don\u2019t like me and I don\u2019t like them\u201d (quoted in Duffy 2018).<\/p>\n<p>In 2017 Ontario\u2019s Office of the Independent Police Review Director compiled records showing that 142 people were fatally shot during interactions with police between January 1990 and December 2016 (Duffy 2018). Calls for de-escalation training have been made repeatedly in studies and reviews on police violence and mental health with no meaningful improvements. At the end of the day police remain the unaccountable monopoly on violence acting with impunity in communities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Duffy, Andrew. 2018. \u201cBabak Saidi was Dropped off at OPP Detachment for Routine Check-In\u2014Minutes Later He was Shot Dead.\u201d <em>Ottawa Citizen<\/em> January 31. <a href=\"http:\/\/ottawacitizen.com\/news\/local-news\/babak-saidi-was-dropped-off-at-opp-detachment-for-routine-probation-check-in-minutes-later-he-was-shot-dead\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/ottawacitizen.com\/news\/local-news\/babak-saidi-was-dropped-off-at-opp-detachment-for-routine-probation-check-in-minutes-later-he-was-shot-dead<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Babak Saidi was shot and killed by Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) outside their Morrisburg detachment only minutes after his father dropped him off for a scheduled probation check-in on December 23, 2017.

He was returned to police custody the following day.<\/p>\n<p>In announcing the end of the investigation on January 30, 2018, the SIU said only that the man was not seriously injured, so the incident did not fall under the agency\u2019s purview.

According to Ritchie, police spent almost 30 minutes talking to the man before things escalated in some way, not specified by police.

Abogado","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2018\/01\/18\/third-trial-for-killer-york-regional-cop-remo-romano-for-killing-natasha-carla-abogado\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-gt","content":"<p>On February 12, 2014, York Regional Detective Remo Romano struck and killed 18-year-old pedestrian Natasha \u201cCarla\u201d Abogado while driving at speeds of 115 km\/h in a 60 km\/h zone on a busy Toronto street. January 17, 2018, found Romano on trial for the third time for the killing.<\/p>\n<p>His first trial in May 2016 ended in a mistrial when the jury could not reach a verdict. He was acquitted in a second trial later that year but the Ontario Court of Appeal ordered a retrial based on flaw\u2019s in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury. Romano is pleading not guilty. At the outset of the current trial, Superior Court Justice Todd Ducharme told the jury not to research the case, including what happened in the previous proceedings.<\/p>\n<p>Detective Romano struck Abogado while she was crossing mid-block to her family\u2019s home on the south side of St. Clair Avenue East, on her way home from a part-time job. Romano was speeding eastward on St. Clair Ave. E., trying to catch up with other police surveillance members of Project Litterbox, a YRP surveillance investigation into a series of non-violent commercial break-ins where around $500,000 in cosmetics and perfumes had been stolen. He was driving an unmarked truck with no sirens or flashing lights. Romano was trying to catch up to the other officers because he had been at the station retrieving another officer\u2019s firearm that had been forgotten in a desk drawer.<\/p>\n<p>According to the opening statement by Crown attorney Rebecca Schwartz, Romano was driving 115 km\/hr in a 60 km\/hr zone near a seniors\u2019 health centre. Detective William Newton, who travelled in a police vehicle behind Romano, stated that no arrests were imminent as they sped along the busy avenue. He said that Romano was simply \u201ctrying to catch up to the action\u201d (Mandel 2018).<\/p>\n<p>Witness Dorota Taylor saw two police vehicles speed past her. In her testimony: \u201cI thought they were racing because of how close they were to each other and the speed that they were going\u201d (quoted in Mandel 2018).<\/p>\n<p>The jury was told that a senior collision reconstructionist from the Special Investigations Unit, the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, will testify that if Romano had\u00a0 been doing even 80 km\/hr that night (instead of nearly twice the legal limit) he would have been able to avoid hitting Abogado.<\/p>\n<p>We need to remember that killer cop Romano was speeding at twice the legal limit with no lights or sirens to catch up with surveillance team members who were working on a case protecting wealth for private companies, not responding to any immediate threat (and certainly no violent one) to the public. He simply wanted to be part of \u201cthe action.\u201d And he killed Natasha Abogado to do so.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Mandel, Michele. 2018. \u201cThird Trial for Speeding York Cop in Death of Teen.\u201d <em>Toronto Sun<\/em> January 17. <a href=\"http:\/\/torontosun.com\/news\/local-news\/mandel-third-trial-for-speeding-york-region-cop-accused-of-dangerous-driving-causing-death\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/torontosun.com\/news\/local-news\/mandel-third-trial-for-speeding-york-region-cop-accused-of-dangerous-driving-causing-death<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>On February 12, 2014, York Regional Detective Remo Romano struck and killed 18-year-old pedestrian Natasha \u201cCarla\u201d Abogado while driving at speeds of 115 km\/h in a 60 km\/h zone on a busy Toronto street.

British Columbia C Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) has raised questions of \u201cracial bias\u201d and excessive force by RCMP officers in the arrest of Dale Culver (35) of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en and Gitxsan First Nations who died in custody following the arrest in July 2017. In an official complaint filed January 16, 2018, to the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP, the BCCLA also claims that the RCMP in Prince George, BC, told witnesses to delete video footage of the Culver arrest. According to police reports, Culver complained of shortness of breath after arrest and was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.<\/p>\n<p>Culver\u2019s cousin, Debbie Pierre, said she was not informed of his death until 24 hours later. She then found video footage of the arrest posted on social media. In her words: \u201cIt was horrific\u201d (quoted in Kurjata and McKinnon 2018). The family had questions about Culver\u2019s death and contacted the BCCLA to get some answers.<\/p>\n<p>Police reports suggest the RCMP responded to a call about a man allegedly \u201ccasing vehicles.\u201d This claim has not been independently confirmed nor has it been explained what that assumption was based on by caller or police. Police struggled with Culver physically.<\/p>\n<p>It is reported that pepper spray used in Culver\u2019s arrest. When he was put in the back of a police vehicle he appeared to have difficulty breathing. An ambulance was called and Culver collapsed when taken out of the police car. He was pronounced dead in hospital a bit after midnight on July 19, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>According to executive director Josh Paterson, BCCLA has spoken with \u201ca number of people, including eyewitnesses\u201d who allege RCMP instructed people to delete video footage of the arrest (Kurjata and McKinnon 2018). The association questions whether \u201cexplicit or\u00a0 implicit racial\u00a0 bias\u201d played a role in the encounter and arrest. BCCLA says it has been told there were \u201cseveral hours\u201d between the initial call to police and the arrival of RCMP on the scene (Kurjata and McKinnon 2018). This raises obvious questions about Culver was approached and, specifically, whether it was because he was Indigenous.<\/p>\n<p>In the words of the BCCLA complaint:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe question on what information or basis the member or members of the RCMP began their interaction or questioning of Mr. Culver, and\/or a request to identify himself, in the first place.\u201d (quoted in Kurjata and McKinnon 2018)<\/p>\n<p>Debbie Pierre is left with the same question. In her words: \u201cWas Dale targeted because of Dale or was he targeted because of his being Indigenous\u201d (quoted in Kurjata and McKinnon 2018).<\/p>\n<p>The Independent Investigations Office of BC (IIO) is also investigating, as it does in cases of police harm to civilians in the province. IIO chief civilian director Ron MacDonald says the IIO was independently aware of allegations of witnesses being told to delete video footage. He also said the IIO was aware of questions regardding police use of force and the timing of Culver\u2019s arrest.<\/p>\n<p>Culver had three children, the eldest of whom is now 14.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Kurjata, Andrew and Audrey McKinnon. 2018. \u201cBC Civil Liberties Association Files Complaint Alleging RCMP Told Witnesses to Delete Video of Arrest\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em> January 16. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/british-columbia\/civil-liberties-iio-pg-rcmp-1.4489925\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/british-columbia\/civil-liberties-iio-pg-rcmp-1.4489925<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The British Columbia C Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) has raised questions of \u201cracial bias\u201d and excessive force by RCMP officers in the arrest of Dale Culver (35) of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en and Gitxsan First Nations who died in custody following the arrest in July 2017.

Quebec Cop Simon Beaulieu Let Off by Courts After Driving Over Guy Blouin","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2018\/01\/14\/killer-quebec-cop-simon-beaulieu-let-off-by-courts-after-driving-over-guy-blouin\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-gn","content":"<p>The state protects the state. Killer cops are rarely charged in Canada. And when they are, they are typically acquitted, even in cases in which they have obviously acted in a dubious, reckless, or murderous manner.<\/p>\n<p>Quebec City police officer Simon Beaulieu backed his police car over Guy Blouin on September 3, 2014, killing the 48-year-old. Beaulieu used this lethal force against Blouin for no other reason than a baseless suspicion that Blouin had stolen a bike. This was apparently a case of class-based police profiling of a working class person in a working class neighborhood. Blouin had, in fact purchased his bike. Officer Beaulieu was charged in October 2015 of criminal negligence and dangerous driving causing death after he struck and killed Blouin.<\/p>\n<p>On Friday, January 12, 2018, killer cops Beaulieu was found not guilty on both counts by Quebec Court Judge Ren\u00e9 de la Sablonni\u00e8re. A not surprising result, no matter how unjust.<\/p>\n<p>De la Sablonni\u00e8re said the elements of proof presented to him did not show without a reasonable doubt that Beaulieu&#8217;s actions that day were dangerous, despite the fact that he sped backwards the wrong way on a one way street and drove over a cyclist who had, in fact done nothing wrong and posed no threat to the public or the officer. The judge concluded: \u201cThis was a sad and unfortunate accident\u201d (quoted in Page 2018). But actively driving backwards over someone on a bike is not an \u201caccident.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The judge reached his conclusion despite the fact that the Crown prosecutor&#8217;s expert witness was a S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec crime reconstruction expert (another cop) who testified the police cruiser was going 44 kilometers per hour when it struck Blouin. The judge simply decided to side with the defense version of events which posed the police cruiser\u2019s speed at 22 kilometers per hour. Why side with defense (posing a self-interested estimate) against one provided by a police expert (usually believed unquestioningly in cases against civilians)? The answer is that the state is always predisposed to protect the state in cases of police harm to civilians, under even the most egregious circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly, De la Sablonni\u00e8re said Beaulieu made sure the coast was clear before backing up. This despite that obvious case that it was not clear\u2014as evidenced by the fact that <em>he ran Blouin over<\/em>. How could he have ensured the coast was clear? Then the judge blamed faulty ABS brakes, a scenario only raised by a defense promoted and provided witness. Said de la Sablonni\u00e8re: \u201cHe could not foresee there was a problem with the brakes\u201d (quoted in Page 2018). But why was he speeding backward toward someone on a bicycle anyway? That is the question.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout his ruling De la Sablonni\u00e8re repeated that in order for a person to be found guilty of criminal negligence, his actions had to be significantly out of step with what is considered to be normal behavior. But he made sure to stress that normal or expected behavior had to be considered differently for police officers than for civilians (see the contradiction there\u2014normal defined as different for some).<\/p>\n<p>Stuart Edwards, a member of a citizens&#8217; committee from the working class Saint-Roch neighborhood where the accident happened, pointed out that the reasoning behind the ruling is hard to accept (Page 2018). And clearly it is for anyone not ready to accept class-profiling of poor ad working class people or to treat police in a privileged manner within a legal system that otherwise brags of \u201cequality before the law\u201d (yes, we know that is a myth).<\/p>\n<p>Said Edwards, from the committee formed in response to Blouin\u2019s killing and who was present in court at each step in the trial: \u201cThat\u2019s a judicial impunity for a policeman, because he\u2019s a policeman. I don&#8217;t buy that. I\u2019m personally disappointed. I don\u2019t accept this \u2014 I think it\u2019s wrong\u201d (quoted in Page 2018).<\/p>\n<p>As should we all. And Edwards noted that the committee is very much concerned with the effect the not guilty ruling will have in the community. It validates the exertion of lethal force by police against people in a poor and working class community under any circumstances and \u00a0with impunity.<\/p>\n<p>The city\u2019s \u201cpolice brotherhood\u201d confirmed that concern saying the court decision recognizes that society must give special consideration to police officers. That sounds a lot like a threat.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Page, Julia. 2018. \u201cQuebec City Police Officer Acquitted of All Charges in 2014 Death of Cyclist.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em> January 12. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/montreal\/verdict-police-officer-guy-blouin-trial-1.4483566\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/montreal\/verdict-police-officer-guy-blouin-trial-1.4483566<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The state protects the state.

Victim of Power (Corp) and Police: The <em>La Presse<\/em> Conflict and the Suffocation of Michele Gauthier<\/p>\n<p>On November 2, 1971, some 2000 people crowded inside and outside the church at Ste-Rosalle, their fists raised in the air in a silent and sombre but striking show of defiance and solidarity, They had gathered together in the rural area, a small village near St-Hyacinthe, some 45 miles southeast of Montreal, to pay respect to a fallen comrade. Her name was Michele Gauthier and she had been killed by police in the service of a government set on protecting a major corporate partner, the <em>La Presse<\/em> newspaper recently purchased by key capitalist power broker Paul Desmarais, head of the aptly named Power Corp.<\/p>\n<p>Michele Gauthier was a young college student at CEGEP Vieux-Montreal. An activist and self identified feminist and Leftist, she had been killed by police during a vicious police attack on a demonstration in support of locked out <em>La Presse<\/em> workers the previous Friday night. During a sustained assault on marchers police fired off rounds of tear gas. Michele Gauthier suffocated from the stifling gas. A brutal and awful way to die.<\/p>\n<p>The police killing of this young college student and activist played a radicalizing role among the broad Quebec working class unlike any seen in other cases of police violence in Canadian history. It would lead many to completely change their view of police and the laws\u2014from being seen as neutral arbitrators of social consensus to violent, interested, upholders of class inequality, exploitation, and fundamental injustice.<\/p>\n<p>This would spur a radicalized willingness to confront, even to break, laws that were now revealed as illegitimate and unjust. It would contribute to a breakthrough against the socialization that teaches conformity, respect for police, and the lowering of expectations to what elites deem to be reasonable or respectable.<\/p>\n<p>Less than a year later it would erupt in the form of a general strike, and a broader insurrection, in Quebec. Only a few years later a second general strike would be launched across Canada on the basis of solidarity, infrastructures, and lessons learned in Quebec.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Aptly Named: Power Corporation, Paul Desmarais, and <em>La Presse<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The <em>La Presse<\/em> strike has its roots in the actions of a notorious and centrally important figure of the Canadian power elite. That is one Paul Desmarais, political funder and Svengali of numerous Canadian parliamentarians of various stripes, including Prime Ministers Brian Mulroney, Jean Chretien, and Paul Martin Jr. At the heart of this power elite nexus is the institution of Power Corporation, the political economic juggernaut run by Desmarais over decades.<\/p>\n<p>Desmarais merged his Trans-Canada Corporation Fund with Power Corporation (the holding company of the Peter Nesbitt Thompson group) and grew it. Power already had a history of union busting, vicious bargaining, and intensification of exploitation (profitability) (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 93).<\/p>\n<p>Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa was a Power director (along with Prime Minister to be Paul Martin Jr.). At least 10 members of the Quebec government\u2019s General Council of Industry were linked to the corporation. Power Corporation Secretary Claude Frenette was former president of the Quebec federal Liberals (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 93). Power was believed to a be a main financial backer for the Liberal Party (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 93). They also maintained strong connections with the Quebec Conservatives. This included connections between Desmarais and future Premier David Johnson (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 94).<\/p>\n<p>Power had secured the largest private media monopoly in Quebec, owning three other daily papers (in Sherbrooke, Granby, and Trois-Rivieres, the three largest weeklies in Montreal, two Sunday papers, 12 other reciprocal weekly papers, and 10 radio and television stations. They controlled ideological production in Quebec for French language media.\u00a0 Onyx Films, a film company owned by Power, actually made films for the RCMP, an interesting wrinkle in power elite relations.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Lockout and Strike at <em>La Presse<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Desmarais bought the <em>La Presse <\/em>newspaper only a short time before the strike of 1971 and his politically motivated actions were largely responsible for it. A strong Rightist and herald of\u00a0 muscular capitalism (neoliberalism), Desmarais sought immediately to turn the paper into a propaganda vehicle for nationalist (federalist) and hyper-capitalist ideology. He targeted journalists who disagreed with or would not capitulate to his mission.<\/p>\n<p>Desmarais sought to provoke an illegal strike of journalists by locking out typographical workers. Knowing the Leftist and unionized journalists would not cross the picket line, Desmarais planned to then fire them. In the words of Alan Hetitage of the International Typographers Union: \u201cI don\u2019t think they were after us. They wanted the journalists. If we had put up a picket line we would have been dead because the journalists would have respected it and lost their jobs\u201d (quoted in Sweetman 2004). The typesetters strategically chose not picket\u2014thus not playing into a setting of a trap for the journalists.<\/p>\n<p>After five months of being locked out the union movement held a mass demonstration, a solidarity strike of sorts, to show support for the locked out <em>La Presse<\/em> workers on October 29, 1971. The company and government moved to attack the workers with legislation. The union organizers were accused of promoting violence simply for striking. At one point workers keenly created a vehicle blockade of the building, parking their cars around its perimeter. This borrowed a famous tactic that had been successful during the 1945 strike by United Auto Workers (UAW) members against Ford in Windsor, Ontario.<\/p>\n<p>The company tried to divide and conquer labor by blaming outside agitators from US unions for provocations and the delay in settlement. Workers turned to labor federations to build boycott campaigns of the newspaper and advertisers (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 98). The company managed to win an injunction prohibiting more than eight people from gathering near the building at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Notably <em>La Presse<\/em> implemented intrusive security, surveillance measures, including microphones to capture conversations among workers and closed circuit television. Thus they innovated measures of labor process management that have now become widespread.<\/p>\n<p>The day after the mass demonstration, on October 30, the reactionary Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau re-introduced a ridiculous and one-sided pro-company anti-demonstration law for the city in consultation with Liberal (neoliberal) provincial Premier Robert Bourassa. This draconian piece of anti-democratic and class-biased legislation had already been declared illegal by Quebec\u2019s Superior Court. Drapeau decided, after consultation with Bourassa, that the bylaw could still be legal because the court decision was under appeal (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 97). In announcing the re-introduction Mayor Drapeau refused to answer questions from the press.<\/p>\n<p>The Drapeau government put a ban of more than eight workers gathering near the <em>La Presse<\/em> facilities. As part of the repressive government defense of their corporate sponsors a no-protest zone of fifty blocks around the <em>La Presse<\/em> building was established in law. It was to be a \u201cforbidden zone\u201d within the city itself. A clear provocation.<\/p>\n<p>Union leaders declared the ban illegitimate. They would march. And with purpose.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The March<\/p>\n<p>Beginning at Square Saint Louis a crowd of more than 15,000 workers showed up in a show of defiance set to march against the corporation and governments at various levels. Public attention on the planned march spread well beyond Montreal (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 97). Public interest and concern were piqued by outrage over the anti-democratic protest ban which was seen clearly as a gift by the government to their corporate allies.<\/p>\n<p>On the day of the march, organizers sought to avoid confrontations and violence by staying along Dorchester Street, the dividing line between the \u201cfree city\u201d and the \u201cforbidden city\u201d (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 98). The march began along St. Denis.<\/p>\n<p>They headed toward <em>La Presse<\/em> headquarters. Picking up parts of the pavement as they marched the demonstrators were confronted by a police barricade outside the <em>La Presse<\/em> building at Craig Street.<\/p>\n<p>On Dorchester, the police had other plans. As they proceeded the demonstrators found their route blocked by hundreds of riot police and several city buses. This left them no option but to continue on St. Denis into Viger Square. Police had set a trap something akin to what today is called a kettle. At Viger Square a cul-de-sac was formed by a police barricade right in front of police headquarters at Craig and Gosford streets (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 98).<\/p>\n<p>The trade union leaders even offered themselves up for arrest in the manner of symbolic protest and civil disobedience. Instead, after only 15 minutes, police charged the crowd.<\/p>\n<p>Police, protecting <em>La Presse<\/em>, moved violently against the assembled workers and supporters. One account describes police actions against the protesters as \u201csadistic\u201d (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 98). People were clubbed indiscriminately. Police sued their three foot long clubs on any and all that they chose or encountered. Neither size nor age offered deterrents against them. The police riot squad was deployed against the marchers. More than 100 Montreal police officers took part in the attack. There were around 60 arrests and around 300 demonstrators suffered various injuries, in addition to the death if Michele Gauthier. Police tracked people down at the local hospital, beating people who sought medical assistance. Tear gas was fired wildly into the streets. It was this mass deployment of\u00a0 tear gas that would kill Michele Gauthier, suffocating her.<\/p>\n<p>The police violence and the killing of Michele Gauthier radicalized the union movement. The union leaders held a press conference the next day. At it they declared their illusions about society shattered. The police they said had behaved in an \u201cinhuman\u201d fashion. They took to calling the police \u201cDrapeau\u2019s Gestapo\u201d and \u201ctwo-legged dogs\u201d (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 98). The Montreal Policemen\u2019s Brotherhood was read out of the trade union movement, where it never should have been in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Yvon Charbonneau said the murderous actions of the police were proof of the \u201ccollusion of the political and economic powers\u201d directed against the working class by this power elite. The result of the police assault was, he said, that the public \u201chas received an accelerated lesson in history\u201d (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 99). It was an important lesson in sociology and criminology too. In that act of brutality the mask of liberal democracy slipped and the police, and the state they are the front line for, were revealed as an institution of bare class power, not an agency of social protection and service.<\/p>\n<p>This was a significant shift, coming in the context of the assault on social resistance undertaken by the federal and provincial governments under the pretext of the October Crisis and the actions of the urban guerilla FLQ. At that time Prime Minister Trudeau had deployed the army to occupy Quebec and hundreds of union and Leftist activists were arrested\u2014despite having nothing to do with the FLQ and its actions.<\/p>\n<p>During the march, notably, nationalist slogans and placards were greatly outnumbered by anti-capitalist ones, such as \u201cCapitalism equals unemployment, socialism equals work [in French]\u201d (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 98). The makeup of the crowd was markedly blue collar. Many had not attended protest marches previously (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 98).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Funeral<\/p>\n<p>At her funeral on November 2, Michele Gauthier\u2019s pall bearers included Marcel Pepin, president of the Confederation of National Trade Unions, Louis Laberge of the Quebec Federation of Labour, Yvon Charbonneau of the Quebec Teachers Corporation, a student from her CEGEP Vieux-Montreal, a member of the Front de Liberation des Femmes, and a press worker representing the locked workers at <em>La Presse<\/em> (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 107).<\/p>\n<p>For observers and commentators at the time, the thousands who attended the funeral and most of the people who they represented in their organizational capacities viewed Michele Gauthier unambiguously as a martyr (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 107). She was remembered as a committed and serious activist in women\u2019s liberation and Left wing politics.<\/p>\n<p>In the <em>Quotidien Populaire<\/em>, the daily paper of the locked out <em>La Presse<\/em> workers, she was given a full page \u201cIn Memoriam.\u201d In it her husband Michel offered a powerful testament:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA victim of violence jointly and deliberately planned by the economic powers and the political powers, this frail young woman lost her life because she dared protest peacefully against those who treat workers like cattle. I dare to hope that this terrible event will help us understand the necessity of uniting in the face of a more and more oppressive power, and to fight for the ideal which animated Michele: a Quebec where liberty, justice and equality reign.\u201d (quoted in Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 107)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Government Inhumanity<\/p>\n<p>The response of the provincial government was particularly despicable, showing starkly the ruling Quebec Liberal\u2019s unflinching, and unconscionable, support for the employers. When Gauthier\u2019s death was raised in Quebec\u2019s National Assembly, the Liberal caucus responded with derisive laughs and hoots. This in response to a police killing of a young student standing with locked out workers being mistreated by an aggressive employer. Liberal Party Whip Louis-Philippe Lacroix went further in asserting the government\u2019s dedication to its corporate masters by calling for an investigation, not of the police or even <em>La Presse<\/em>) but of the <em>labor<\/em> leadership (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 107).<\/p>\n<p>Montreal\u2019s legendary, and infamous, mayor, Jean Drapeau, added his own offensive and insensitive take on events and the actions of his own police force. He stated obnoxiously and contemptibly: \u201cIt\u2019s dishonest to say somebody died because of the events Friday night. Nobody died at the demonstration. Madame Gauthier could just as well have lost her life at the Santa Claus parade\u201d (quoted in Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 107). Yet there was no word from the mayor on how many times or why Santa Claus parade goers have been subjected to bombardment by massive quantities of tear gas.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Organized Resistance<\/p>\n<p>Organized labor in Quebec came out of the <em>La Presse<\/em> battle with a unity not previously seen. As Sweetman suggests: \u201cIt\u2019s often said that few things are more radicalizing than the end of a police baton, and on Oct. 29, 1971, the end of the baton\u2014clearly and deliberately wielded by the state\u2014was felt by the entire working class of Quebec\u201d (2004).<\/p>\n<p>The <em>La Presse<\/em> strike and the various solidarity actions showed a militant and unified model for tactical social action. It suggested\u00a0 Common Front that could bring together diverse workers and overcome divided and competitive craft union models as existed at <em>La Presse<\/em> before the lockout and strike.<\/p>\n<p>The QFL and CNTU, the two main labor federations ended their rivalry and with the Quebec Teachers Corporation formed a Common Front. Notably, newly recognizing their real social basis they called on all progressive forces\u2014political groups, students, unorganized workers, unemployed people, welfare recipients\u2014to join together in a now apparent shared goal\u2014the overthrow of capitalism ad the development of socialism (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 99).<\/p>\n<p>Laberge considered the growing militance and push for socialism as the \u201cgreat national battle\u201d (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 102). Cooperation and pursuit of reforms, which had dominated labor movements in Quebec, were now revealed to be a certain dead end. And this went beyond nationalism to seek a coalition with English Canadian workers against experiences of exploitation and oligarchy that were shared in common.<\/p>\n<p>This Common Front model and the militant direction opened to workers through the strike raised important possibilities for working class organizing and for claims on workers power\u2014even workers control. Such a Common Front could mobilize and support and defend hundreds of thousands of workers. It could provide strength against employers\u2014not only private capital, but the state.<\/p>\n<p>Organization is key. As Laberge would state:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be illusory to dream of some revolutionary cataclysm. Some people believe in effect that the collective consciousness of exploitation will unleash an irresistible liberation movement and all we have to do is to let ourselves be carried along with it. I don\u2019t believe miracles happen by themselves. We have to organize efficiently, starting with often humble and discreet tasks.\u201d (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 106)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>CNTU members were provided a militant study guide: \u201cNe comptons que sur non propres moyen\u201d (\u201cLet us count only on our own resources).<\/p>\n<p>The <em>La Presse<\/em> strike and the solid actions of organized labor, especially during the police assault of October 29, showed the divisions between the working class Left and the Quebec nationalist Parti Quebecquois (PQ). After the police assault PQ leader, and legend, Rene Levesque incredibly had denounced the labor leaders as fanatics. In his words, he would \u201crather live in a South American banana republic\u201d than in a Quebec influenced by the \u201cranting and raving of labour leaders\u201d (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 112).<\/p>\n<p>Before the QFL convention of November 1971 the PQ\u2019s National Council did try to manage some reconciliation, offering a \u201cmini manifesto\u201d expressing support for labor\u2019s goals of democratic restructuring of the economic and social systems. But Levesque silenced Robert Burns, a former CNTU lawyer who sat as PQ member of the National Assembly for Maisonneuve , telling him to leave the party if he did not like it. Burns, for his part, had said that the PQ was acting like little more than the progressive wing of the Liberal Party.<\/p>\n<p>Anglo social democrats and unionists offered chauvinistic and divisive assessments. Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) head Donald McDonald reinforced Trudeau\u2019s view, suggesting that the strikes in Quebec were not strikes but revolutions and sided with his state and corporate bosses in suggesting that they needed to be put down.<\/p>\n<p>Having gained essential experiences in organizing and confidence in their actions, the workers\u2019 movements in Quebec wold provide the impetus for struggles that would be among the most significant of the last half of the twentieth century, not only in Quebec or Canada but in North America. Quebec workers provided the inspiration and organizing force behind the largest general strike in North American history in 1976. The Canada-wide general strike of that year was launched against wage controls promoted by the federal Liberal government of Pierre Elliot Trudeau (yes, the father of that guy). More than 1.2 million workers across Canada took part in the general strike. That strike provided an example of working class solidarity across assumed barriers of language and culture. It provided an important counter to Anglo chauvinism and nationalism alike.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>General Unrest<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the year of 1971, social struggles, class struggles, would build and grow. New levels of labor militancy and direct action would spark and spread. October of 1971 would gain the title of Quebec\u2019s \u201cBlue Collar\u201d crisis (Palmer 2009, 362).<\/p>\n<p>Growing and high unemployment, continuing poverty, and job losses in even higher tech sectors with supposedly greater job security contributed to widespread unrest in the province, not only in Montreal. The crisis for capital and the state would\u00a0 provide a revitalization of labor. Rural protests targeted the corporate monopolies in the resource industries, often the sole major employers in the towns (Palmer 2009, 362).<\/p>\n<p>In Cadillac, a small town between Val d\u2019Or and Rouyn, about three-quarters of the town took part in a week long highway blockade to stop the shutdown of the molybdenite mine that they viewed as theirs, not capital\u2019s (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 103). In Manneville, about 400 miles northwest of Montreal, the townsfolk fought against riot police who had been transported in to repress protests over woodcutting rights (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 103). The whole town at Mont-Laurier mobilized against wood plant shutdowns throughout 1971. In Shawinigan, home of federal cabinet minister, and future Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chretien, there were numerous demonstrations.<\/p>\n<p>Residents of Cabano blockaded railways and blew up bridges used by KC Irving after the company failed to live up to promises to build a plant and increase jobs in the area (Palmer 2009, 362). They even threatened to set fire to the company\u2019s existing facilities.<\/p>\n<p>In Sept-Iles, two thousand steelworkers and 1500 machinists walked out of the American owned companies (Palmer 2009, 362). One journalist, Malcolm Reid, reported on the Sept-Iles uprisings as follows: \u201cThey don\u2019t read much Trotsky in Sept-Iles. But the workers of this iron port way out east on the St. Lawrence put themselves at the head of the May revolt in Quebec with something that looked like what Trotsky called \u2018dual power\u2019\u201d (quoted in Plamer 2009, 362). This is a remarkable claim, suggesting that workers were devising and developing new forms of self-directed, self-governing activity outside of, beyond, and against the formal apparatuses of state and capital. These were manifestations of working class self-determination in formation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Common Front<\/p>\n<p>The shared experiences of state repression and recognition that the state was willing to take the lives of people standing for social justice and to respond to such atrocity with no remorse, steeled the labor movement. It would encourage a further coming together in solidarity that would see a Common Front developed over and against previous divisions within the labor movement and between its various groupings.<\/p>\n<p>Many familiar with Canadian labor history will know of, at least in some general detail, the Quebec Common Front and the General Strike of 1972. Involving more than 300,000 workers, it was, up to that point, the largest general strike in Canada. Infamously union leaders, including Louis Labarge, Marcel Pepin, and Yvon Charbonneau were arrested and sentenced to a year in jail for urging striking workers to break state injunctions against them.<\/p>\n<p>The Common Front was formalized politically at a mass rally at the Montreal Forum, famed home of the legendary Montreal Canadiens hockey team, only four days after the police assault on the <em>La Presse<\/em> demonstration. Around 14,000 people turned out on only 24 hours notice for a militant and affirmative show of solidarity and resolve (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 99). The meeting was chaired by Michel Chartrand and Louis Laberge, Yvonne Charbonneau, and radical lawyer Robert Lemieux. Much of the Quebec trade union leadership participated.<\/p>\n<p>Michele Gauthier\u2019s memory was a present and vital part of the evening. Referencing the assault by police and ensuing street battle only a few nights previous, Louis Laberge declared from the podium:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe give serious warning to the wealthy and to the established powers that this first victim might be followed by others, but in future the victims won\u2019t only be on our side\u201d (quoted in Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 100).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Speakers one after the other called out and condemned the governments of Trudeau (federal), Bourassa (provincial), and Drapeau (Municipal). They identified the struggle as a battle against \u201cthe wealthy, propertied capitalists\u201d and for \u201cdemocracy, social and economic justice, liberty and equality (Chodos and Aud der Maur 1972, 99-100). These were distinctly and emphatically declarations of class war\u2014on the other side, the side of the exploited against the exploiters (Chodos and Auf der Maur 1972, 99).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mass Direct Action<\/p>\n<p>In response to the state jailing of the union members in an attempt to break the strike, workers upped the ante. Several towns on the North Shore were operated by and defended by workers (including Joliette, Sept-Iles, Sorel, and Thetford). Numerous factories in the towns became worker run organizations for the period of the strike. This signalled a potential move from a strike to workers control of industry. It posed the prospect of revolution in real terms. Several television stations were taken over by workers and 22 radio stations were controlled by workers. Anti-union newspapers were simply forced to stop publishing over that period. Entire towns came under workers control.<\/p>\n<p>When news of the jailing of Laberge, Pepin, and Charbonneau reached Sept-Iles, a community on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River, unionized workers left their jobs and initiated something of an insurrection. They blocked the only road leading into town, they closed the airport, they took over the local radio station (CKCN). Within hours their town was truly their town.<\/p>\n<p>In response, the local bourgeoisie organized a vigilante group to inflict violence on the workers and to seize back the property they believed to be theirs (as capital believes all property to be as their natural right). The name of their vigilante group was a priceless statement of bourgeois law and morality. The Comite des Citoyens Respecteux de la Loi et de \u2018lOrdre was headed up by the president of the local Chamber of Commerce.<\/p>\n<p>A statement released on behalf of 6500 union workers in Sept-Iles stated: \u201cWe have finished with respecting laws that crush people, laws that are defined by the traditional elite\u201d (Gellner 1974, 170). The bourgeoisie was more focused on property and its typical disparagement of workers. In their statement they explained themselves:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGoons, drunkards, loudmouths\u00a0 and revolutionaries were taking over <em>our<\/em> town and were sabotaging <em>our<\/em> homes, hurting <em>our<\/em> businesses and breaking up <em>our<\/em> property. It was time for us to take affairs in our own hands and end the <em>reign of terror<\/em>.\u201d (Gellner 1974, 169, emphasis added).<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the real issue was that the police force that had always taken care of these things for the property owners and business elites were frightened into inaction for once. So the usual customary, legal and \u201crespectable\u201d means of the state, usually reliably available to capital was, in this instance, not available. And as a result its real social function was once again put on proper display.<\/p>\n<p>The general strike was successful in winning several concessions from employers or from government. The arrested and sentenced union leaders had their sentences reduced, to four months from one year. Even more, bosses were put on the defensive, unable to carry out their preferred or desired austerity plans against the working class.<\/p>\n<p>Some politicians and bosses might have come to believe that revolutionary syndicalism might have been put in the grave alongside the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919. The <em>La Presse<\/em> strike of 1971 showed that revolutionary syndicalism still existed or had been resurrected in a Canadian context. And it showed that it still provided the most striking model of effective working class resistance, even in a distinct economic, political, and cultural context.<\/p>\n<p>Said jailed CNTU President Marcel Pepin in 1972:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNot since the days of the <a href=\"https:\/\/libcom.org\/history\/articles\/iww-usa\"><em>Industrial Workers of the World<\/em><\/a>, since the days of <a href=\"https:\/\/libcom.org\/history\/articles\/murder-joe-hill\"><em>Joe Hill<\/em><\/a> and the battle for the eight-hour day, has a North American union movement been so dedicated to the tradition of revolutionary syndicalism.\u201d &#8211; Marcel Pepin (jailed President of the Confederation of National Trade Unions, 1972)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Common Front was so widespread that police were put into the position of acknowledging, against their own preferences, that they could neither contain it not put it down. Instead they were, again and again, in setting after setting, <em>compelled<\/em> to stand back. They understood that they would lose any decisive clash in that context of united workers power. And this is a crucial lesson to be held throughout.<\/p>\n<p>It confirmed the claim pressed by syndicalists historically of the power of the general strike. A mass mobilization of the organized working class committed to militant action and self defense can sideline the police and their repressive force. This is <em>the<\/em> lesson of class struggle and revolutionary syndicalism.<\/p>\n<p>Yet while many will know something of the Common Front and 1972 general strike, few if any will recall or know anything about the catalyst for the uprising of May 1972. That is the 1971 strike at the <em>La Presse<\/em> newspaper and the police violence against striking workers that left a young feminist and Leftist student, Michele Gauthier, dead at the hands of Montreal police.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>The <em>La Presse<\/em> conflict would become one of the signal events in labor history in Quebec and in Canada. Yet it is largely forgotten outside of Quebec. And the name Michele Gauthier, and the causes\u00a0 for which she stood, has been largely lost to history. This is an effect of power. We are too often left unaware of the humble heroes who, without fame or attention, put themselves on the line to stand for social justice and a better world against forces of control and domination, exploitation and repression.<\/p>\n<p>This silencing allows power to tell its own particular story about our society and its true character. In Canada, the overlooking, the too easy forgetting, the silencing of the screams of pain, the muffled gasps, of regular people striving for a better world, has allowed state and capital, politicians and police, bosses and brigands to pose the country\u2019 history as one of peace and progress rather than regressive and repressive violence. It allows power to paint a picture of a social consensus that has never existed and is only an image imposed by force.<\/p>\n<p>Michele Gauthier\u2019s sacrifice and her commitment, her active pursuit of solidarity and search for a better world must not be left to history. It must return as a part of the present of social justice and struggles against the everyday violence of power. She helped to galvanize a movement and forge commitments which posed revolutionary alternatives as real world prospects. She contributed to a development of working class solidarity and unity that seemed unlikely only months before.<\/p>\n<p>This is of growing importance today in a period in which forces of reaction and outright fascism and ruling class brutality are on the upswing and growing. It is absolutely crucial as the exploited and oppressed look for examples of winning strategies and tactics and new ways of envisioning social alternatives to the dominant structures of power and domination, dispossession and accumulation. And as people in struggle debate the nature of the state and the nature of resistance and protests and seek to affirm the legitimacy and necessity of community self defense and militant collective direct action.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Chodos, Robert and Nick Auf der Maur. 1972. <em>Quebec: A Chronicle 1968-1972<\/em>.

Heffernan was alone in his hotel room, holding a syringe, and posing no threat to the public or police, when Calgary police officers broke down the door to the room, burst in, and shot the 27-year-old four times, twice in the head. The officer in question fired six time in total that day in March 2015. The syringe Heffernan was holding had no needle attached. Despite the fact that the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the agency that examines case of police harm to civilians in Alberta, found that there were grounds to charge the officer responsible criminally, the Crown prosecutors decided not to lay charges.<\/p>\n<p>On January 10, 2018, Anthony Heffernan\u2019s parents found out that their bid to have a judicial review of the decision not to lay charges in the case was not granted. Court of Queen\u2019s Bench Justice John Henderson ruled that there is no evidence to support the parents\u2019 allegation that there was an abuse of process by the Crown.<\/p>\n<p>This does not answer why the Crown chose not to follow the ASIRT recommendation to charge the officer nor does it explain how breaking down a door and firing six shots at someone for holding a piece of plastic is justifiable or reasonable force, or does anything to protect the public. The state protects the state.<\/p>\n<p>The Heffernan family had argued that the officer fired recklessly and wildly. They have filed a lawsuit against the police service.<\/p>\n<p>The Calgary police force had been involved in six fatal police shootings over two years in 2015 and 2016.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Anthony Heffernan was alone in his hotel room, holding a syringe, and posing no threat to the public or police, when Calgary police officers broke down the door to the room, burst in, and shot the 27-year-old four times, twice in the head.
