These show both the delay in responding to police killings in Canada as well as the limited framework for addressing police violence and lethal force.<\/p>\n<p>The coroner\u2019s inquest noted that officers took more than four hours to each the residence at Whitefish Bay after the initial call was made reporting an incident at the home, May 9, 2010. This became notable for the jury because by the time the Emergency Response Team arrived the situation had escalated well beyond the incident that gave rise to the call to police. Indeed Gray had taken time to leave the site of the initial incident on at least one occasion returning to his own home before returning.<\/p>\n<p>According to the initial report of the provincial police oversight body, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) Gray had actually released a hostage right before police responded by shooting him several times killing him. He apparently gave out a large scream right before he was shot but one would hope this did not startle officers causing a panicked response. Gray was still conscious after being shot and police handcuffed him before taking him to an ambulance. He died at the Sioux Lookout Meno Ya Win Health Centre. In any event the SIU, not surprisingly, determined that the police execution of Gray was justified. They cleared three OPP officers involved in killing Gray.<\/p>\n<p>The coroner\u2019s inquest jury found that Brian Gray was killed died as a result of multiple &#8220;gunshot wounds to the torso&#8221; (Porter 2016). The jury ruled Gray\u2019s death to be a homicide. In this context the ruling means that the death is \u201ca result of the purposeful actions of another person and does not carry any criminal connotations\u201d (Porter 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The jury made 18 recommendations with regard to the inquiry in Gray\u2019s killing and these did recognize the problems within the O.P.P in terms of aboriginal awareness and interactions with indigenous civilians. As is disproportionately the case in incidents of lethal police violence against civilians the person killed is experiencing a mental health issue that finds a response not in care but in policing. Among the 18 recommendations issued by the jury are these:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOptions for more effective tactical response should be explored, including but not limited to enhanced Emergency Response Team (ERT) training, upgrading the North Western Region ERT team to level 2 Tactical capabilities, and placing a Tactics and Rescue unit (TRU) team in Northern Ontario.<\/p>\n<p>The OPP should ensure that all members working with aboriginal communities and people receive Aboriginal Awareness Training that should be updated when necessary.<\/p>\n<p>When OPP Officers are deployed in a location where they might be expected to attend on a First Nation, they should attend and be familiarized with that First Nation soon after being deployed to that Detachment.<\/p>\n<p>When a critical incident occurs, an individual or individuals should be identified by Lac Seul First Nation to liaise between the police, First Nation and family of the subject, for the purpose of improving communication, and keeping the families informed of the progress of an incident.<\/p>\n<p>Lac Seul First Nation should receive funding to hire a certified mental health counsellor, to hire and train additional mental health workers, to train its existing mental health workers, and to increase awareness of mental health issues and to initiate early intervention within the community.\u201d (Porter 2016)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>None of the recommendations from a coroner&#8217;s inquest are binding.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Porter, Jodie. 2016. \u201cPolice Killed Northern Ontario First Nation Man, Inquest Jury Concludes.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/thunder-bay\/police-shooting-lac-seul-first-nation-1.3579724\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/thunder-bay\/police-shooting-lac-seul-first-nation-1.3579724<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Six years after Brian Gray, 39, was killed by members of the Ontario Provincial Police Emergency Response Team at Whitefish Bay on the Lac Seul First Nation in Northern Ontario, the jury in the coroner\u2019s inquest into his killing has released its recommendations.

Police Kill Andr\u00e9 Benjamin: Mental Distress and Victimization,

killings of people apparently experiencing mental distress or ill health are becoming an all too regular occurrence in the Canadian state context. Indeed, numerous studies and inquiries note the alarming numbers of people dealing with mental health issues who are being set upon and killed by police forces at all levels and across the country. It is also true that these killings are taking place even as report after report calls for improved training for police in understanding and responding to people dealing with mental health issues, training in non-lethal interventions and suitable equipment, and most importantly alternatives to police in situations involving mental health emergencies. Still police are sent to intervene against people in distress and still people continue to be killed by those police.<\/p>\n<p>On Monday, April 25, 2016, a 63-year-old man, identified as Andr\u00e9 Benjamin, was both tasered and fatally shot by Montr\u00e9al police in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood. The victim was shot by police around 8 AM during a police intervention a few blocks away from the city\u2019s iconic Olympic Stadium. He was taken to hospital where he was declared deceased. According to police reports, the Montr\u00e9al police were called to an apartment block at Ontario Street and Sicard Street regarding someone in apparent psychological distress. The call was reportedly made by a family member of the victim (CBC News 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Poignantly, the police shooting of Andr\u00e9 Benjamin comes a mere six weeks after a coroner\u2019s report was delivered in the police killing of Alain Magloire, another resident of the city who was killed by police while suffering mental distress. Magloire was shot and killed by police two years ago near the city\u2019s bus station (CBC News 2016). The coroner&#8217;s report did recommend the use of stun guns rather than service firearms by police but also called for more extensive and better training for officers in appropriate dealing with people experiencing mental health issues.<\/p>\n<p>Alain Magloire\u2019s brother, Pierre Magloire, expressed sorrow that another man has been killed by the Montr\u00e9al police force. He sees training rather than equipment as key. In his words: &#8220;It makes me sad that someone, again, has been shot. It\u2019s like I\u2019m always asking for more [training,]. It\u2019s not because you have a stun gun that everything will go away and everything will be fine&#8221; (quoted in CBC News 2016). The killing of Andr\u00e9 Benjamin confirms this in the most brutal terms.<\/p>\n<p>As is the situation in Quebec, where there is no independent investigations unit that would examine killings by police of civilians in the province, the case has been turned over to another force, in this case the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec (SQ), the provincial police force. The SQ confirmed Monday afternoon that a taser was deployed by police during the encounter. The victim was also struck by at least one bullet fired by police.<\/p>\n<p>The Qu\u00e9bec government has been criticized by the province\u2019s Human Rights Commission for long delays in instituting an independent agency to investigate shootings, serious injuries, and deaths of civilians that involve a police officer. While the provincial government has voted to create an independent investigations unit it is yet to be operational three years after the vote was recorded (CBC News 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Montr\u00e9al police have a rather infamous history of lethal force. Annual day against police brutality events, held on March 15 each year, have origins in protests against the force. The protests were initiated in 1997 by the Coalition Opposed to Police Brutality and often involve direct action.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>CBC News. 2016. \u201cMan, 63, Dies after Being Shot by Montreal Police in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.\u201d CBC News.

British Columbia shot and killed a mother and her son in an encounter in the early afternoon of Thursday, April 21, 2016. Family members of the victims have identified the deceased as Shirley Williams, 77, and son J\u00f4van Williams, 39. The mother and her son were confronted by police at the mother\u2019s home in the small village of Granisle on Babine Lake.<\/p>\n<p>RCMP reported having been called to a \u201cneighbour dispute involving a handgun\u201d at around 12:30 PM local time on Thursday (quoted in CBC News 2016a). Arriving at the home about 1:22 PM they surrounded the home and report attempting to make contact with the residents. Police report that one person exited the home and sometime thereafter shots were fired at approximately 2:50. A second person then reportedly exited the home with shots being fired once more. Paramedics were reported to be waiting nearby and the two victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Anne Williams, a teacher and twenty-year resident of Granisle who was friends with Shirley Williams, reported that she saw five police cars at the shooting scene as well as officers with rifles (CBC News 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>J\u00f4van Williams was a carpenter who had also worked in security with the Lake Babine First Nation. His aunt, June Williams, reported that he had recently left the security guard job with the Lake Babine Nation to live with and help his mother (CBC News 2016b). Mother and son were longtime residents of the village of Granisle. Residents reported seeing the pair often out together around town. Strangely the local director for the regional district, Tom Liversidge, jumped to conclusions publicly about the shooting suggesting a police friendly take. Without explaining further or providing evidence he suggested: \u201cIt\u2019s really a shocking thing. I know everybody is very surprised. Nobody expected that this lady or her son were violent\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2016a).<\/p>\n<p>The incident is presently under investigation by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) the police oversight agency in British Columbia responsible for investigating instances of civilian harm or death involving police officers. Eight Independent Investigations Office investigators have been sent to the village to carry out the investigation. The sheer volume of such instances in the province over the last few years has contributed to a serious backlog of IIO investigations and growing frustration over the lack of answers in several killings by police over that time span.<\/p>\n<p>A stricken June Williams was left to reflect: \u201cMy niece has no more mom and no more brother now. They were decent people, they were not troublemakers\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>CBC News. 2016a. \u201cPolice-Involved Shooting Kills 2 in Northern B.C.

does an argument between a landscape professional and a careless resident watering the lawn during a drought and city water use restrictions end up with the concerned landscaper being killed by police? How is it that a young man, described as quiet and peaceful, comes to be viciously attacked by police officers using chemical weapons and is beaten so brutally that his grieving family has to have a closed casket funeral?<\/p>\n<p>These fundamental questions remain to be answered in the case of the police killing of Myles Gray. This despite the pleas of family members for information. Other fundamental questions stand out with regard to police involved killings of civilians in British Columbia. So too do questions about the supposed investigations unit and civilian concerns with oversight of police in the province.<\/p>\n<p>How is it that in a province in which there is a supposedly independent investigations unit legislatively tasked with investigating all cases in which police harm or kill a civilian there is no report years after the killing? And how is it that despite requirements that police immediately notify the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) when such occasions of force against civilians have occurred, and involved officers not communicate with one another, that there can be both a delay in notification and communications between involved officers, yet no officer is punished or in any way held accountable? And why, in British Columbia, are so many families of victims killed by police left with no answers and no insights into the events that left their loved ones dead at the hands of officers?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Suing for Answers in the Police Killing of Myles Gray<\/p>\n<p>Six months after their son was killed by police, under mysterious, troubling, and still shrouded circumstances, in a backyard in Burnaby, the parents of 33 year old Myles Gray are still seeking answers. Among the few basic facts that are known about the killing of Myles Gray on the afternoon of August 13, 2015, is that officers encountered the young man after responding to a call regarding a disturbance on the 3600 block of South East Marine Drive in Vancouver. It is also known that that afternoon Myles Gray, who worked as a greenery supplier to local florist wholesalers, had argued with a woman who was watering her garden during drought restrictions. Beyond that questions abound.<\/p>\n<p>Having received no insights into their son\u2019s death at the hands of police they have been compelled to file a lawsuit against the Vancouver police and 11 of the force\u2019s officers. This is the only means available to them to get an honest response from police about what happened when their son\u2019s life was taken.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the Vancouver Police Department and the officers, the Grays, along with Myles Gray\u2019s evergreen supply company, Graystone Enterprises Ltd, also name the City of Vancouver and the Vancouver Police Board in the lawsuit. The board is cited for \u201cfailing properly and effectively to educate, train and supervise the officers to appropriate professional standards\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016).<\/p>\n<p>In the suit, Myles Gray\u2019s parents, Margie and Mark Gray of Sechelt, allege that seven of those officers, still identified only as \u201cJohn Does,\u201d wrongfully killed their son by beating him to death. According to the claim, the police killed Myles Gray by using \u201cgrossly excessive force\u201d and \u201cinflicting massive physical trauma \u2026 with no valid, lawful reason\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016). The suit also alleges that officers had no lawful cause or authority to detain Myles Gray and that he was repeatedly beaten, even after he had been restrained. All officers involved have been and remain on active duty since the killing.<\/p>\n<p>Margie Gray reports being told that her son died within minutes of the encounter with Vancouver officers. Her assessment is stark, and accurate: \u201cThis is \u2018comply or die\u2019 policing. Like, what was the rush to move in and kill him?\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016). Adds Mark Gray: \u201cYou know, they could have let him calm down \u2026. like a person\u2019s life is worth more than a (few) minutes, right?\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016). The family, and indeed many reasonably thinking people, can envision a broad range of alternative approaches that could have been taken that would not have left a young man beaten to death.<\/p>\n<p>Grieving father Mark Gray is left with the terrible question: \u201cWhy was he killed off, just hunted down like a dog, killed like a dog, worse than a dog?\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Families of almost all victims of people killed by police in Canada are provided with very little information about what the police did to their loved ones. They are almost never given the names of officers involved as these are not even made available to the general public. This is the case for Myles Gray\u2019s parents. Their requests are straightforward and legitimate. Says Margie Gray: \u201cI want answers. I want to know what happened that day. It&#8217;s the worst. It is horrific. And to know this went down at the hands of people you&#8217;re supposed to trust\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What is Known<\/p>\n<p>The day Myles Gray would be killed by police begins routinely enough. On a hot August day, the young greenery supplier was on a regular run of deliveries to flower wholesales in the area around Boundary Road and Marine Drive in Burnaby. Sometime around 2 pm, Gray wandered away from a loading bay and walked across a small overpass above Boundary Road, a dividing line between Burnaby and Vancouver. Coming down the overpass he found himself on the 3600 block of South East Marine Drive in Vancouver. A lover of the outdoors Myles Gray often went for walks during breaks in his delivery schedule. According to ahis father he left his keys, backpack, and identification inside the delivery van and headed off in the direction of a nearby park (Olivier 2016). Based on a map of the area it is believed that Myles Gray was heading toward Everett Crowley Park on the Vancouver side of Boundary Road. A worker at the florist supply store where Gray made his delivery saw him leaving with his headphones on. They waved at each other (Olivier 2016). According to his father: \u201cThere is a little park up there. He did the loop and was heading back. And I guess he saw this lady watering her grass\u201d (quoted in Olivier 2016). It would prove to be a fatal encounter.<\/p>\n<p>According to a neighborhood witness, Gray and a local woman ended up in an argument as she watered her garden under conditions of drought restrictions. At the time of the encounter, Metro Vancouver was under a Stage 3 restriction on water use and this included a complete ban on watering of lawns (Olivier 2016).<\/p>\n<p>While it might not seem at all out of the ordinary for a greenery worker to be concerned about water usage on a lawn during a drought, for some reason police were called in this case. That fact raises real concerns about social disconnection, authoritarianism, and snitch tendencies within a fear culture, but these questions cannot be answered here.<\/p>\n<p>What is clear is that 911 was called by the woman\u2019s son and police responded (though again it might be asked why police treated an argument over lawn watering as a priority incident or why the person arguing against lawn watering during a drought was viewed as a perpetrator).<\/p>\n<p>The woman involved has told reporters that she did indeed contact police after a verbal exchange with a man over her use of her water hose during a watering ban.\u00a0She insists that she had never intended for anything bad to happen to him. It all began with a painful banality. She simply wanted the young man to go away (which it seems he was going to do on his own anyway). Upon finding out that the man had died through his encounter with police she says she was devastated (Olivier 2016). She says now: \u201cI cried. Now when I talk about it, I get really angry\u201d (quoted in Olivier 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Upon encountering Gray the Vancouver police officers chase their presumed target across a Boundary Road overpass into Burnaby. Having cornered Gray in a residential yard police deploy the Orwellian named \u201cchemical agents\u201d and then \u201cphysical force\u201d supposedly in an effort to restrain him. A short time after the encounter in the yard, and still an apparently short time after police first engaged him Gray was pronounced dead. It is also known that Myles Gray\u2019s injuries were so severe that the funeral home suggested there not be an open casket funeral.<\/p>\n<p>According to the lawsuit filed in BC Supreme Court, Gray was \u201calone, unarmed, dressed in shorts and not engaged in any criminal activity during his interactions with the seven officers\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016). He was killed in the secluded backyard of a house in the 8300 block of Joffre Avenue. This was a mere 10 minute walk from where the original complaint had been made to police (Olivier 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Immediately after Myles\u00a0Gray was killed his father Mark visited the backyard where his son was killed by police. The yard on Joffre Avenue backs into a steep ravine filled with blackberry bushes (Olivier 2016). The father believes his son was at that point cornered with nowhere to go. This raises further questions about why police could not have engaged him more cautiously and communicatively. Why did they quickly move to force? He could have posed no harm to the general public or bystanders. He could not have gotten away. Mark Gray says that when he visited the yard there were still signs of the struggle. He saw patches of blood, torn up grass, and a destroyed rhododendron bush (Olivier 2016).\u00a0The thought of what happened is unbearable:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t get past what happened \u2014 I can\u2019t move on. I just feel bad that I wasn\u2019t there to help him. I just wish I was there to help him. I would have in a second died for my son. I still would love to be dead and he still been alive. The thought of him, thinking how he suffered\u2026\u201d (quoted in Olivier 2016)<\/p>\n<p>According to a police news release issued after the killing, one of the few communications from any state authorities in this case, Vancouver police reported that their members responded to a call of a distraught man causing a disturbance. The police account reads in part:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe [Gary] became agitated and additional officers were called to the scene. Attempts to subdue the man with chemical agents were unsuccessful. A physical altercation ensued, resulting in injuries to the man and six officers. Paramedics were called to attend to the man. He died at the scene.\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016)<\/p>\n<p>None of this, including the timelines involved (when police were sent, when reinforcements were sent or arrived, when chemical agents were applied, what the altercation consisted of) has been confirmed by independent sources. No specific details on any of this have been provided publicly in any way.<\/p>\n<p>Even more the lawsuit suggests interference by police with the investigation by the Independent Investigations Office in British Columbia, the unit charged with investigating cases in which civilians are injured or killed by police. The lawsuit alleges that \u201cthe police unlawfully impeded the investigation \u2026 by the Independent Investigations Office by failing to immediately notify the IIO of the killing\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016). Myles Gray\u2019s parents allege that during the delay, \u201cofficers failed to preserve evidence\u201d and \u201cconferred among themselves\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016). These claims are similar to the case of police involved in the killing of Robert Dziekanski in which the officers responsible were found to have colluded in crafting their explanation of what happened (before evidence in a citizen video showed what really occurred). Ironically perhaps it was the inquiry into the Dziekanski killing that led to the formation of the provincial police oversight body in British Columbia.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sounds of Silence: The Authorities (Do Not) Respond<\/p>\n<p>Another thing that is known is that for six months authorities have remained silent on the cause or he conditions surrounding Myles Gray\u2019s death. The blue wall of silence remains solidly in place in this case. The Vancouver Police Department only offer this: \u201cIt wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate for the VPD to comment on an ongoing IIO investigation or a pending civil process\u201d (quoted in Rankin). For its part the BC Coroners Service claims that it cannot comment while the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) investigates the case. At the same time the IIO, through spokesperson Marten Youssef insists: \u201cOur investigation in this critical incident is ongoing. We are currently waiting on third party reports\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly, and this is a situation we have discussed previously in some detail, one of the main reasons put forward by the IIO for the ongoing delays in its investigations is the fact that police in British Columbia are harming and killing so many people over the last few years. As Youseff claims:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe timeliness of our investigations has suffered recently, in large part, as the result of a rash of officer-involved shootings and police-involved fatalities throughout the province that began in September of 2014 and continued for the better part of a year (a total of 20 shootings and fatalities in a period of 12 months).\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016)<\/p>\n<p>One might ask whether the delays in the face of growing police violence is related to the training hat IIO investigators receive from the Justice Institute of British Columbia, the training academy staffed by and geared toward police officers. One might also ask why provincial resources are not forthcoming given the apparent need to step up investigations of officers through the IIO?<\/p>\n<p>In the face of this terrible situation the Gray family asks for de-escalation training to be improved within the Vancouver Police Department. Their wish is that changes will come, in part through the impetus of their lawsuit, so that their son\u2019s death will not have been in vain.<\/p>\n<p>Gray\u2019s parents knew him as someone who was gentle and walked away from fights. If he was involved in some sort of difficulty on August 13 it was not in character. In fact there is still no evidence that suggests Myles Gray was either in a vulnerable state or suffering from some sort of mental health crisis (apart from any stress caused by being chased and attacked by police of course)a psychotic break. Neither is there any evidence to suggest that he was under the influence of any intoxicants. On the morning he died he was reported to be happy and in normal spirits according to his workers.\u00a0While granting that something could have upset him later, though there is no evidence for this, the family and colleagues also note that it need not have led to his death: \u201cMaybe he was having an emotional meltdown. He was probably in a vulnerable state. They pursued him for sure. What he needed probably was some compassion\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016).<\/p>\n<p>And compassion is certainly what Myles Gray did not receive. The list of people in need of compassion who instead encounter police is a growing one in the Canadian context.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Comply or Die<\/p>\n<p>As in numerous other cases in which several police encounter someone who is spatially contained with nowhere to go, and no way to harm bystanders, there are serious questions why police so quickly resort to lethal force. The mindset and practice of the police assert a framework in which the only option is \u201ccomply or die.\u201d A purely authoritarian assertion. Recommendations have long been made about better training, including de-escalation training. Others have raised the possibility of mental health or health care professionals responding instead of or along with police.<\/p>\n<p>These are questions that weigh on Mark Gray. He suggests: \u201cThey should definitely have better training. If there&#8217;s seven of them, one should have said, \u2018Hey, let&#8217;s back off\u2019 and treat this a little differently in how it went down. It could have gone down a lot differently. And Myles could have been alive today\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016).<\/p>\n<p>This sentiment is echoed by Margie Gray. In her words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere needs to be a change in the way they deal with people. They need more training in their de-escalation skills. They just need more training, period \u2026 no one should have to live through what we\u2019ve been living through. It\u2019s a living hell. I do not want any family to ever have to go through what we\u2019ve been going through.\u201d (quoted in Rankin 2016)<\/p>\n<p>She further adds: \u201cEven getting the details are not going to bring my son back. But in going forward, hopefully there is going to be change. This cannot happen to anybody else. Because I feel like if this happened to our family, it can literally happen to anyone\u2019s family\u201d (quoted in Olivier 2016). Given the histories of police killings of civilians in Canada there is little reason for optimism that charges will be laid against any of the officers involved.<\/p>\n<p>And no family should have to go through any of this. In too many cases police are deployed in cases for which they are neither prepared nor equipped. At the same time they interact in those situations, even where the behavior that brought the call is minor, on an absolutist basis pursuing the authoritarian and violent lines that have been ingrained in them (and which are the basis of their operations). With no leeway, or inclination, to soften the approach or act in a more nuanced way. Of course, real care, service, and protection of regular humans in need has never been the purpose or role of police in state capitalist contexts (or any other context for that matter).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion: Why Call the Cops Anyway?<\/p>\n<p>From another, more critical, perspective one might question why state authorities are deployed in such circumstances at all. Clearly arguments over lawn care, and civic responsibilities during water shortages, should not result in calls to the state or to the deployment of armed forces. Larger questions remain about sociality and social engagement in anomic, detached, privatized societies. One of the problems with policing is that it breeds reliance or dependence on policing. People do not resolve social differences, even minor ones, through discussion or agreement to disagree, Instead the initial, almost reflexive, response is to call the cops. And unfortunately the cops are all too willing to oblige (it builds public relations and helps maintain or increase budgets after all). So-called \u201ctough on crime\u201d or broken windows approaches I the context of broader socio-political cultures of fear and panic only make things worse.<\/p>\n<p>The sociologist Emile Durkheim suggested that in stratified societies with a broad division of labor, as in advanced capitalist modernity, are subject to conditions of anomie or a breakdown of shared norms, values, and beliefs (the conscience collective). Such societies are marked by a lack of trust among people and a tendency toward dependence on authorities. Under these conditions, and manipulable fear that accompanies them, people turn too readily to authorities and are too accepting of the actions taken by authorities however egregious they might be. Thus police are able to kill and get away with killing while remaining silent or worse obstructionist or disassembling in the face of questions from the loved ones of those whose lives have been taken.<\/p>\n<p>As Mark Gray puts it: \u201cI want my son back, but that\u2019s never going to happen. It could be (that) other people will have their son killed, and it\u2019s just not right the way they treat people. It\u2019s just not right\u201d (quoted in Ranking 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Olivier, Cassidy. 2016. \u201cThe Day Myles Gray Died.\u201d <em>Vancouver Sun<\/em>.

Independence: Active Officers and the Independent Investigations Unit in Manitoba","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/16\/killing-independence-active-officers-and-the-independent-investigations-unit-in-manitoba\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-3l","content":"<p>Despite the ongoing and consistently stated desires of civilian populations for independent civilian oversight of police forces in the Canadian context it is still the case that independent oversight or investigations units have not been established in all provinces. Even more though in those provinces in which supposedly independent investigations units have been established there are very real and serious concerns about the lack of actual independence of these units from police agencies. This includes cases of the outright presence of police officers as members of these units or the use of police to deliver compulsory training to unit members.<\/p>\n<p>The Independent Investigation Unit in Manitoba (IIU) was only founded in 2011. Yet it has taken very little time for the unit to succumb to problems of involvement of police and concerns over lack of transparency that have quickly overtaken other units in Canada. On April 15, 2016, it was announced that a key civilian member of the Manitoba Police Commission has quit the position over concerns that police officers are investigating themselves (CBC News 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Robert Taman was appointed to the nine-person commission in 2011 but has resigned due to what he calls a &#8220;difference of opinion&#8221; regarding police involvement in the IIU. In resigning his position Taman reported that an active member of the Winnipeg Police Service joined the Independent Investigation Unit in April and as a result he came to the conclusion that he must quit his position. The conflict of interest and lack of independence and integrity this implies for investigations of officers seem rather straightforward and clear. In Taman\u2019s words:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To have them actually conduct an investigation against one of their former brothers in a crime situation, I think they would have a difficult time separating themselves in the situation, and I just feel it should be an outside source. It has to be done a certain way. And I don&#8217;t think anything has gone awry; I think everybody&#8217;s trying hard to put together something that&#8217;s going to work. I just think sometimes things aren&#8217;t done quite the way they should be done, because it doesn&#8217;t quite fit within the government parameters.&#8221; (quoted in CBC News 2016)<\/p>\n<p>This is a particularly poignant case of independence being invalidated by the presence of a police officer given that the IIU in Manitoba was created as one of the recommendations following from an inquiry into the police killing of Robert Taman\u2019s wife in 2005. Taman has been a tireless advocate for accountability and integrity in policing, and civilian oversight, since his wife, Crystal, was killed in a crash involving an off-duty Winnipeg police officer (CBC News 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Crystal Taman, a 40-year-old mother of three, was killed when her car, which had stopped at a traffic light, was struck by a pickup truck driven by off-duty Winnipeg police officer 31-year-old Derek Harveymordenzenk (also known as Derek Harvey-Zenk). Harveymordenzenk had spent that evening partying with colleagues. As a result of his killing Taman he received only a two-year conditional sentence. This after pleading guilty to dangerous driving causing death. There was great public outcry over the light sentence given Harveymordenzenk. This led to a provincial inquiry that concluded with recommendations for what were to be substantial structural changes to the practice of policing in Manitoba.<\/p>\n<p>The provincial inquiry examined what was a dubious police investigation into the crash and made recommendations including the establishment of a police commission and independent investigation unit. Members of the Manitoba Police Commission are appointed by the provincial government which has raised some questions of political interference, favoritism, or coercion. It is the commission that assigns civilian monitors to investigations conducted by the Independent Investigation Unit in cases in which a civilian is killed or suffers serious injury in incidents involving police officers (CBC News 2016).<\/p>\n<p>At the time of formation of the Manitoba Police Commission in 2011, then provincial Attorney General Andrew Swan had much to say about civilian input and oversight and accountability measures regarding police. In his words at the time:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This diverse group of men and women will play a fundamental part in providing a new era of civilian input, governance, transparency and accountability in the delivery of policing services in Manitoba. We&#8217;re taking the next step in replacing outdated legislation with the new Police Services Act, ensuring that our police officers are supported with a modern act and that citizens can play a crucial role in overseeing the delivery of policing services well into the future.&#8221; (quoted in CBC News 2011)<\/p>\n<p>A new Police Services Act was drafted following the recommendations of the Taman Inquiry, and the appointment of the Manitoba Police Commission was viewed as the first crucial step in implementing the Police Services Act. Since its founding the commission has been tasked with providing advice on required policing standards including matters of police training and equipment. The commission also helps to train the local police boards that were established in areas operating their own police services. Local police boards trained by the commission are given the power to hire the police chief, propose and administer police budgets, as well as setting the overall direction and operation of its police service (CBC News 2011).<\/p>\n<p>In addition it is the commission that was charged with recruiting and training the roster of people who were supposed to monitor investigations of police incidents involving harm as well as allegations against police officers by the IIU. This roster was supposed to be composed of civilians as Attorney General Swan stated in his announcement of the first commission.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly the independent character of the IIU in Manitoba has been formally ended. This is a fate that took little time in arriving. It is by no means the exception in the Canadian state context. Indeed it is the (all too predictable) rule.

violence against indigenous people and communities remains the ongoing practice of settler colonialism within the Canadian state context. This includes lethal force. Yet systemic racism and colonialism are rarely addressed in investigations of police violence. Many officers are oblivious to the colonial histories of their own institutions. Many have no understanding of colonialism at all.<\/p>\n<p>On Wednesday, April 6, 2016, Sandy Tarzan Michel, 25, was shot by police on a small Algonquin reserve in Lac-Simon in Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue about 500 kilometres northwest of Montr\u00e9al. Shockingly, reports suggest the young man was first struck by a police cruiser and later shot several times by police. According to provincial police Sgt. Benoit Coutu, officers from the Lac-Simon force were responding to reports of a man allegedly brandishing a knife as he was walking in public (Canadian Press 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Sadly Sandy Tarzan Michel is not the first member of his family to be killed by police. In January 2009 his brother, Johnny Junior Michel Dumont, only 19, was shot and killed by police in Lac-Simon. Strangely police also said that Dumont was holding a knife at the time they killed him.<\/p>\n<p>The community, which has been subjected to police violence, confronted local police and tried to stop the entry of provincial police, the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, who were called to assist the local force. Residents apparently blocked the entrance of police vehicles. Three people were arrested by the police at the scene.<\/p>\n<p>SQ spokesperson Sergeant Daniel Thibodeau used these words to describe the situation: &#8220;It&#8217;s a high emotion type of situation that this community is not used to dealing with &#8230; Incidents from the past have carried over so there&#8217;s a bit of a build of tension&#8221; (quoted in Shingler 2016). It is not likely that the \u201cincidents from the past\u201d referred to be Thibodeau include ongoing practices of systemic racism and colonialism.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike in other provinces, including Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, there is no independent unit to investigate incidents in which police officers injure or kill civilians. Instead another police force is asked to investigate in such cases. In response to the killing of Sandy Tarzan Michel, Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux initially tasked provincial police with conducting the investigation into the situation resulting in this killing. This was surprising given that members of the Lac-Simon force had been n communication with provincial police the evening of the killing and had come to the assistance of the local force. The S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec had sent a dozen officers to lend a hand to the local force (CBC News 2016). Responsibility for the investigation was finally moved to the Montr\u00e9al police force. In any event few would suspect a thorough and critical review into the case by any fellow force.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Community Not Cops<\/p>\n<p>Provincial police have been given supervision of the territory as the investigations move forward. Incredibly the SQ asked members of the press to stay away from Lac-Simon while they investigate (CBC News 2016). Around 1,200 people live in the town.<\/p>\n<p>The police officers\u2019 association in Lac-Simon has taken advantage of the killings to call for still more policing resources in the area and has blamed what they call a \u201cpublic security crisis\u201d in the community. Yet community members refer instead to a public health crisis and speak to issues of health, economic inequality, and harm reduction.<\/p>\n<p>Michel\u2019s family has relied on the support and care of people in the small community after having two loved ones taken from them by police in strikingly similar fashion. They report that many have reached out to contact and support the family.<\/p>\n<p>According to Judith Brazeau, the partner of Michel\u2019s father: \u201cWe are living with our pain. We help each other a lot. If someone is hurting, there is always someone there\u201d (quoted in Northcott and Laframboise 2016).<\/p>\n<p>In a public show of support for the family and anger at the police violence inflicted on their community, around 100 people marched Friday afternoon, April 8, to protest the circumstances surrounding Michel\u2019s killing by police.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Canadian Press. 2016. \u201cMan Dies after Being Shot by Police on Algonquin Reserve in Quebec.\u201d Metro.

Shooting","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/06\/human-rights-mental-illness-and-killings-by-cops-the-beau-baker-shooting\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-3d","content":"<p>It happens far too often in Canada. A person experiences emotional distress or mental health issues. Someone observing contacts authorities. Rather than a health care worker, police are sent to the scene. Instead of acting in a helpful caring way, they quickly resort to orders and violence. And someone who could and should be supported ends up dead. Police who kill people under such circumstances are almost never held accountable by the criminal justice system. Now families may be beginning to turn attention to the violation of human rights that occurs when someone suffering mental illness is treated with violence because they are suffering mental illness or distress.<\/p>\n<p>On April 2, 2015, Waterloo Regional police in Kitchener, Ontario shot Beau Baker seven times, killing him. At the time police engaged him Baker was suffering through a mental health crisis. Police were aware of this but still did nothing to calm him or deescalate or involve mental health care workers. Rather they took the typical authoritarian command approach that has led to numerous documented injuries and deaths at the hands of police in Canada. As family lawyer Davin Charney suggests: \u201cThat type of command (approach) doesn\u2019t work for people in a mental crisis\u201d (quoted in Sher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mental Health and Human Rights Violations by Police<\/p>\n<p>Police in Canada have a dubious history of killing people experiencing mental health crises. The too often employed response is one of confrontation, order, escalation, and, finally, force, often times lethal. Approaches that acknowledge distress and seek communicative alternatives are rarely used. And outcomes are predictably deadly. As Charney notes: \u201cIt\u2019s playing out across the country again and again. Beau did not deserve to die\u201d (quoted in Sher 2016). It seems to have become too easy for police to quickly resort to lethal force in such cases. With impunity.<\/p>\n<p>Beau Baker\u2019s mental illness now forms a basis for a lawsuit claiming that police discriminated against him in a way that violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Ontario Human Rights Code. On April 4, 2016, the family and estate of Beau Baker filed a six million dollar lawsuit claiming that the young man was killed by Waterloo Regional police without provocation and in violation of his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The lawsuit further charges that the police knew that Baker was mentally ill when they encountered him and then tried to cover up their misdeed. The lawsuit also names Waterloo Regional police Chief Brian Larkin and the police services board as defendants.<\/p>\n<p>The lawsuit claims that the 20-year-old victim was standing with his arms above his head, holding a beer in one hand and a knife in the other, when one of two police officers who had guns pointed at him fired seven times, with one bullet severing his aorta, killing him. According to the lawsuit\u2019s statement of claim: \u201c(Beau) was not moving towards either officer. After he was shot, Beau fell to the ground in the exact same spot that he had been standing when the first officer had arrived\u201d (quoted in Sher 2016). This is supported by eyewitness testimony.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Not So Special Investigations<\/p>\n<p>In response to notice of the lawsuit, Waterloo Regional police Staff Sgt. Mike Haffner issued a statement: \u201cAny death in our community is tragic. With the loss by the Baker family, they have decided to take legal action against the service. It would be inappropriate for the service to comment as this process has just commenced\u201d (quoted in Sher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>As is typically the case in the Canadian context details of the killing, including the names of officers involved have not been revealed to the family or the public. This is an issue that deeply troubles critics as well as advocates for public transparency and openness in government and public institutions. Transparency and openness are by no means hallmarks of policing in Canada. Indeed secrecy, protections, and the blue wall of silence (reinforced by public agencies like the SIU) are the order of the day. In this the often self-congratulatory Canadian systems could learn from examples in the United States in which officers are named publicly, often fairly soon after an incident of police violence.<\/p>\n<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the provincial agency that investigates cases of police encounters that involve civilian injury or death, had assigned eight investigators to probe the shooting. It is by now well established, through reviews and reports released by the provincial ombudsperson, that police obstruct, deceive, and lie to the SIU. The lawsuit in this case claims that officers did not provide truthful statements to the SIU investigators. According to the lawsuit: \u201cThe officers made false and self-serving statements to the SIU with the purpose of avoiding criminal liability. The [officers] intentionally misled the SIU and corrupted the investigation into the death of Beau\u201d (quoted in Sher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The SIU concluded that the officer who fired the shots and killed Baker was justified in doing so. This conclusion was based on the reports of officers. In what can only be described as a perverse, even sadistic, assessment, the SIU went so far as to claim that the officer who killed Baker was justified in firing seven shots because the young victim did not fall until the last shot was fired.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Alternative Views<\/p>\n<p>Yet the perspectives and testimony of witnesses suggest something other than the SIU sanctioned version of events. Witness Muhammad Zafar, 46, reported seeing the shooting from his cousin\u2019s apartment across the street. In his view: \u201cThere was a guy with a knife in front of the building. It looked like a kitchen knife. He was saying something and police were also saying something\u201d (quoted in Carruthers 2015a).<\/p>\n<p>Another witness Dan Mazurek said he saw the shooting from the vantage point of his fourth-floor balcony. He reported the killing as follows: \u201cA lady who lived in the apartment, who was a friend of the guy who got (shot), she was yelling and crying to the cop to not shoot him. I saw the cop with his gun drawn and this guy sitting on the ground\u201d (quoted in Carruthers 2015a). According to Mazurek, he heard five gunshots from the officer, who was standing about three to 4 1\/2 meters from the victim.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, Mazurek reported that Baker was never close to the officer. He also noted that there was no attempt by police at de-escalation and the shooting came very early into the encounter. In Mazurek\u2019s view: \u201cThe kid was nowhere near him. I did not see any [de-escalation] and within two seconds onto the balcony, the cop fired off five shots. There was another female cop behind her door of the police car\u201d (quoted in Carruthers 2015a).<\/p>\n<p>Witnesses and friends alike cannot fathom why police responded with lethal force. Those questions remain. Beau Baker\u2019s friend Crystal Pettigrew remembered: \u201cHe\u2019s not a violent person and he would never hurt anyone. I think everybody just wants real answers. They didn\u2019t have to kill him\u201d (quoted in Carruthers 2015b)<\/p>\n<p>Another friend Gracelynn Fortin, 16, spoke with Baker an hour before he was killed by Waterloo police. She echoes the view of others that her friend was kind and unthreatening. In her view: \u201cBeau wouldn\u2019t dare try and hurt someone. He was not a violent person. He was probably the most kind, caring person you could ever meet\u201d (quoted in Carruthers 2015b). She believes that if anything he was raising a \u201ccry for help\u201d the night he was killed (Carruthers 2015b).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>While police only ever seem to see a threat, or a target, people who knew Baker recall a loving, kind artist. Indeed, according to family Beau Baker had plans to be a tattoo artist and was trying to put together the equipment to start his career. It was something at which he was said to be quite talented.<\/p>\n<p>His mother, Jackie Baker, remembers a loving son. In her words: \u201cBeau was one of the most thoughtful and loving people I have ever met. Since he was a young boy he made gifts for people. He bought me a rose for one of my birthdays and I still have the petals\u201d (quoted in Sher 2016). She suggests that her son\u2019s battles with anxiety worsened following the death in 2011 of a grandmother who was his best friend. This led to a turn to smoking pot and eventually drinking. Jackie Baker has a chilling recollection of the last time she spent and her son spent together:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe day before he was taken from his two brothers and myself I had met him at the doctor\u2019s office to get a new prescription for his medication. I gave him a new shirt in an army green colour. We parted ways at the bus stop and I gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek and told him I love him. As I walked away I kept looking back for some reason.\u201d (quoted in Sher 2016)<\/p>\n<p>Her son is among the victims of people dealing with mental health issues who are killed by police in Canada. It is a long and troubling list. One that shows have inappropriate, and unacceptable, it is to have police intervening in cases of mental stress and illness.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Carruthers, Dale. 2015a. \u201cSpecial Investigations Unit Probing Deadly Kitchener Shooting.\u201d <em>London Free Press<\/em>.

perceptions of whistleblowers have evolved over recent decades to a point in which whistleblowers are viewed as important, even crucial, contributors to democratic practice as well as key players in developing safe, healthy, and just workplaces, communities, and societies. This has been underlined by the significant role of workplace whistleblowing around issues of health, safety, and corporate criminality as well as by the role of public whistleblowing such as the cases of Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden.<\/p>\n<p>One sector within twenty-first century society in the Canadian context that takes a decidedly reactionary and regressive approach to whistleblowers and whistleblowing is, not surprisingly, policing. In this police are similar to other sectors of the state. Indeed, policing at the highest levels, views secrecy, obfuscation, non-transparency, and outright distortion as its natural, and proper, order of things. This has not changed with public demands for openness or with the development of supposedly independent investigations units to deliver some modicum of public oversight and transparency.<\/p>\n<p>So it may not be at all surprising, but still comes as rather repulsive, that the chief of the Calgary police and ranking members of the Calgary Police Association are openly condemning, even threatening, officers who speak with reporters without authorization of their bosses. Calgary police Chief Roger Chaffin goes so far as to suggest that he is working to \u201croot out\u201d officers who provide information to media confidentially. In his words: &#8220;That&#8217;s part of my quest. I want to find out who&#8221; (quoted in Fletcher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>This active concern with rooting out truth tellers within the force comes as someone revealed confidentially to CBC News that the officer involved in the fatal shooting of David McQueen in January 2016 was, at the time he killed McQueen, already under an open investigation for killing another man, Anthony Heffernan, less than a year before. Rather than expressing concern over this grim fact and seeking to do something about it, the chief has made it his mission to go after, not the killer cop, but whoever made it known that he was a multiple killer.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Love it or Leave It: Police Associations against Whistleblowers<\/p>\n<p>If police chiefs are aggressive in their desire to root out whistleblowers, police associations are downright extremist. This is the case with the force in Calgary. Paul Wozney, a director with the police association and the editor of the association magazine published a vitriolic defense of the chief\u2019s pursuit of whistleblowers. His editorial supports Chief Chaffin\u2019s decision to send a &#8220;strongly worded&#8221; memo warning officers that they face stiff consequences for leaking information to the media (Fletcher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Wozney is fairly spitting blood when he rages in his article: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that the member you blabbed about, who responded to two extremely high risk calls and had to make split second decisions in the interests of their own personal safety and the safety of the community, has a right to feel safe with their own organization?\u201d (quoted in Fletcher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>He continues more forcefully: &#8220;It disgusts me that one of our own members (sworn or civilian) would choose to make such a selfish decision\u201d (quoted in Fletcher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The us-versus-them mentality that is a staple of policing, and contributes to police violence against civilians is on full, brutal display in Wozney\u2019s self-righteous rant: &#8220;To be blunt, we have enough butt-holes in the media, the community, and on the defense-side of the bar taking shots at us. We don&#8217;t need our own members taking shots at each other in our own magazine&#8221; (quoted in Fletcher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Wozney further makes clear that only compliant \u201cyes sir\u201d voices will be allowed in the association\u2019s magazine. No room for conscientious objectors, dissenters, or simple truth seekers.<\/p>\n<p>He takes the authoritarian approach that no criticism can be offered and only acceptance of the status quo is permitted. This is the \u201cmy way or the highway,\u201d \u201clove it or leave it,\u201d \u201cmy country right or wrong\u201d psychology that underlies, and reinforces, authoritarian institutions like the police. In his words: &#8220;If you are some sort of unhappy employee, then I suggest you leave the organization or join the fire department\u201d (quoted in Fletcher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Stunningly, officer Wozney cannot imagine any reason why an officer would want to provide information about police wrongdoing to the media. Especially since \u201cthe media sure doesn\u2019t pay for this information\u201d (quoted in Fletcher 2016). Why else would a cop do the right thing except for pay?<\/p>\n<p>While Wozney refuses to speak with media about the aggressive approach taken in his magazine, Police Association president Howard Burns stands by the publication and its editor. In his view: &#8220;I don&#8217;t necessarily disagree with the article. You have to appreciate that this magazine is meant for the 2,100 members of the Calgary Police Association. So, it&#8217;s not really meant for public distribution, although it&#8217;s fine for it to be in the public eye&#8221; (quoted in Fletcher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The police association notes that members who provide information to the media without authorization could be disciplined and even face termination. So much for respect for whistleblowing. They prefer officers go through authorized channels such as the Calgary Police Services media relations wing or through the union.<\/p>\n<p>Association head Burns notes that the leak in the Heffernan case will not even compromise the investigation since it is concluded. He admits:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think in that particular case, that investigation, my understanding is it&#8217;s been concluded and is before the Crown in Edmonton. So I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to interfere but it certainly can be confusing for the public when they hear mixed messages and they start to hear about confidential sources. It&#8217;s probably not the appropriate way to do business&#8221; (quoted in Fletcher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dubious Assumptions<\/p>\n<p>Police officials, both in the association and in management operate under a dubious assumption that secrecy does not damage their reputation. They seem oblivious to the damage done by ongoing practiced secrecy. At the same time they replay another of their famous myths, this one that openness and forthright reporting puts officers in danger (playing into another myth that everyday policing is particularly dangerous). The Calgary chief suggests: &#8220;When it gets released without proper attention to details and policy, it puts people at risk. It puts the reputation of policing at risk, and it can really harm the work we do and the members and the organization&#8221; (quoted in Fletcher 2016). The key part of this attempt at dissembling is the note that truthfulness really puts the reputation of police at risk. And indeed openness, honesty, and transparency about policing would certainly lead many civilians to more fully question the institution\u2014a necessary and justified outcome.<\/p>\n<p>While being controlling and secretive they also manage to convince themselves that they are open. According to Calgary\u2019s chief: &#8220;We do have a very open policy and a very transparent way to talk to media around here, generally speaking. But when it involves operational issues or personnel discipline issues that are within the organization, there are things that we want to have some controls over&#8221; (quoted in Fletcher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly, observers suggest that the Calgary force is more open, One can only imagine the shadow activities of previous regimes if that is in fact true.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For the Families<\/p>\n<p>Whatever the police chief and the police association might prefer, the public and the family of Anthony Heffernan are quite thankful to whoever leaked the information about the police killer of Heffernan and David McQueen.<\/p>\n<p>Victim Anthony Heffernan\u2019s father Patrick Heffernan, argues for greater police openness and accountability and is rather shocked by the tone of the police association\u2019s defense of secrecy. In his view: &#8220;The police, they should be open.\u00a0The public should know what&#8217;s\u00a0happening. This notion that they are to protect each other \u2026 rather than necessarily having the truth out \u2026 I think that&#8217;s totally wrong&#8221; (quoted in Fletcher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>It is telling that the Heffernan family, let alone the public, still has not been informed of the names of the officers responsible for killing their son. In the view of the family the investigation into their son\u2019s killing by police has lacked transparency throughout.<\/p>\n<p>Anthony Heffernan\u2019s brother, Grant Heffernan, reported that the family only learned that the officer who shot and killed his brother was also involved in the January 25 killing of Dave McQueen through the CBC News report and reporter Meaghan Grant. Grant Heffernan\u2019s assessment of the police interaction with the family is stark: &#8220;They basically lied to us&#8221; (quoted in Khandaker 2016).<\/p>\n<p>According to Grant Heffernan the whistleblowing was crucial and necessary. In his words: &#8220;That is the only way we knew, and if a source in the Calgary police wants to talk to the media, they should be able to do that&#8221; (quoted in Khandaker 2016). This seems like a straightforward position, one that the public is supportive of.<\/p>\n<p>The great significance of whistleblowing for the families of victims of police killings is clear and unequivocal. According to Grant Heffernan: &#8220;We want to know this information. We have been in the dark with a lot of what&#8217;s been going on with the investigation. There&#8217;s a lot of things we don&#8217;t know about and the Calgary police won&#8217;t tell us. To us, this was important information&#8221; (quoted in Fletcher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Grant Heffernan was left incredulous and repulsed by the responses of the chief and the police association. He reported: &#8220;They basically said there&#8217;s going to be a witch hunt for the guy who came out to the reporter. We&#8217;re very grateful this guy did come out and had the courage to stand up for us\u201d (quoted in Khandaker 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Reading Wozney\u2019s article was a shock. In Haffernan\u2019s view: &#8220;What kind of language is that if you&#8217;re in charge? How can you use that kind of language in a respectable position? It&#8217;s unbelievable to me&#8221; (quoted in Khandaker 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The Heffernan family is at this point hopeful that a murder charge, almost unheard of in cases of police killings of civilians in Canada will be laid against the as yet unnamed officer.<\/p>\n<p>In the Canadian state context, federal law protects whistleblowers who report illegal or troubling behavior, but only in situations in which they report the case of wrongdoing to a state law enforcement agency. Workplace protection is not extended to those who provide whistleblowing information to media. Media leaks have indeed resulted in criminal investigations and prosecution against both journalists and whistleblowers in the Canadian context (Khandaker 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Fletcher, Robson. 2016. \u201cCalgary Police Chief on &#8216;Quest&#8217; to Root Out Confidential Media Sources from His Ranks.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

Heffernan","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/27\/free-to-kill-again-calgary-cop-killed-david-mcqueen-while-under-review-for-killing-anthony-heffernan\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-37","content":"<p>In the Canadian state context there are few legal outcomes as rare as a police officer being convicted for killing a civilian. It is rare enough that an officer who kills someone is even charged for the taking of someone\u2019s life. This is true even in those provinces that have separate investigations units that look into killings by police rather than simply turning a case over to another police force to \u201cinvestigate.\u201d Indeed as the recent decision by Ontario\u2019s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) not to bring charges in the police killing of Andrew Loku and ongoing criticisms of the backlogged Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia show, these agencies remain limited, and often impede by or too close to, police departments involved in killings. The Loku killing in particular has led to community mobilizations by Black Lives Matter Toronto and allies.<\/p>\n<p>Still it is safe to assume that most residents of provinces that have a dedicated unit that investigates police killings of civilians, like Alberta, would expect that any officer involved in killing a civilian would, at the very least, be taken off of active street duty while under investigation or before any conclusions are released to the public. If an officer may have acted inappropriately, unduly, disgracefully it would only make sense that they would not be released upon the public until review of the officer, their outlook, and conduct was completed and some assessment made. Surely a killer cop would not be turned out on the streets to kill again.<\/p>\n<p>Well, incredibly, stunningly, it seems that just such a situation has been allowed to happen in Alberta with, perhaps predictably, lethal consequences. On January 25, 2016 David McQueen, a quadriplegic, was shot by three Calgary police officers while in his wheelchair inside the doorway to his house. In March 2016 it was revealed that one of the officers who shot McQueen was, at the very moment he fired his weapon, under investigation by the province\u2019s investigation unit ASIRT (Alberta Serious Incident Response Team) for killing another man a year earlier. And he had not been cleared of wrongdoing in the previous killing.<\/p>\n<p>Less than a year before, on March 16, 2015, the officer who would be involved in McQueen\u2019s killing, had shot Anthony Heffernan four times, three times in the head, while the young man was alone and in some distress, but defenseless, in a hotel room. In fact police broke down the door to forcibly enter Heffernan\u2019s room in a Hotel 8 before shooting him.<\/p>\n<p>Said Grant Heffernan, Anthony\u2019s brother, upon hearing the news that the very cop who killed his brother had killed again: &#8220;I am more than outraged that this happened to somebody else in Calgary\u201d (quoted in Grant 2016). The family had been told by ASIRT that as of November 2015 the officer had not returned to work but was actively trying to get back on the job (Grant 2016). Heffernan suggests that family could have dealt with the officer being placed on administrative duty, though they by no means saw this as ideal in the circumstances (Grant 2016). They were shocked that he had been returned to the streets. As Grant Heffernan said upon hearing that the same officer that killed his brother had killed again: &#8220;This is unfathomable that this happened and is totally unacceptable&#8221; (Grant 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The Heffernan family lawyer echoed those sentiments. Tom Engel, commenting on the return of the officer to street duty ahead of being cleared by ASIRT and the Alberta Crown prosecutor:\u00a0 &#8220;Frankly, it&#8217;s shocking. You have to respect the presumption of innocence. I don&#8217;t think that you should necessarily suspend the officer from all police duties, but you certainly would take him off the street so that he wouldn&#8217;t be in a position to do that again&#8221; (quoted in Grant 2016).<\/p>\n<p>There are many questions to be answered in trying to figure out how a young man missing his check-out time could escalate so quickly to his being shot and killed by police. When he had no weapon and no capacity to harm the public (being isolated in a hotel room by himself).<\/p>\n<p>There are also significant questions about how and why an officer under review for a killing of a civilian could be out on the streets to kill again. When a police officer is involved in a shooting, he or she is placed on a minimum 30 day administrative leave. At the end of that period, an evaluation is supposed to be undertaken to determine whether the officer can return to active duty and whether restrictions, and what type of restrictions, will be placed on them following their return. In this case it is not yet clear why the officer was allowed to return to the streets and what, if any, restrictions governed their activity.<\/p>\n<p>On Thursday, March 17, 2016, the Heffernan family reported that the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team has finally told them that it has recommended murder charges. The decision to lay charges rests with the Crown prosecutors. In Grant Heffernan\u2019s words: &#8220;ASIRT is pressing hard,&#8221; (Stark 2016). This is, of course, welcome news. Charges are, as we have noted, rarely laid against officers who kill civilians, even in instances where the case would appear straightforwardly to demand charges be brought.<\/p>\n<p>The news from ASIRT has brought some comfort to the family. Grant Heffernan suggests it is helping their recovery: &#8220;I feel a little better about it. We were very skeptical about ASIRT and any officer being charged&#8221; (quoted in Stark 2016). The family will not know until May 1 whether the Crown will, in fact, follow through and lay charges against the officer.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, while the police have not responded formally to this news they did offer a rather arrogant, and perhaps knowingly confident, expression of their awareness that no homicide charges have ever been laid against a Calgary police officer (Stark 2016). Such has been too consistent practice in Canada when police brutalize or kill civilians.<\/p>\n<p>The Heffernan family has filed a complaint under the Police Act. That case can go before the law enforcement review board even if charges are not formally laid against the officer (Grant 2016).<\/p>\n<p>For Grant Heffernan there is only one appropriate outcome. That is to ensure that the cop cannot kill a third time. In his words: &#8220;The only way there is going to be any accountability and justice, is if the subject officer who killed my brother &#8230; faces criminal prosecution&#8221; (quoted in Grant 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Grant, Meghan. 2016. \u201cAnthony Heffernan, Dave McQueen Both Shot by Same Calgary Police Officer.\u201d CBC News.

Police Killing of Alex Wettlaufer: The One No One Worried About","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/15\/toronto-police-killing-of-alex-wettlaufer-the-one-no-one-worried-about\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-31","content":"<p>When Toronto police pointed their guns at Alex Wettlaufer, the 21 year old was alone, isolated, and afraid. His family heard his fear as they spoke with him by phone moments before he was fatally shot by police.\u2014Paramedics were called to the scene at 11:34 PM. Taken to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Alex Wettlaufer would die of his wounds in the early morning of March 14, 2016.<\/p>\n<p>Police were reportedly responding to reports of two men fighting at the Leslie subway station in the late evening of March 13. How this would lead them to confront and kill Alex Wettlaufer in a park, Villaways Park, blocks away is not readily known.<\/p>\n<p>What is known is that police claims about the confrontation, and the claim that Wettlaufer had a weapon, do not mesh with what family members heard over the phone as the young man plead with police to lower their weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Wettlaufer was speaking with his family by phone moments before he was fatally shot by police. According to his mother, Wendy Wettlaufer: \u201cHe was crying, saying that he\u2019s being surrounded. They kept telling him to put the weapon down, and he kept hollering telling them he didn\u2019t have a weapon\u201d (quoted in Wilson 2016)<\/p>\n<p>According to his sister, Melissa Wettlaufer: &#8220;He told them it was just a phone, but they shot him anyway\u201d (quoted in Gillis 2016). His loved ones heard him tell the police he only had a phone and try to get them to put their guns down.<\/p>\n<p>Responding to police claims, the victim\u2019s mother said: \u201cAlex does not carry a gun, he\u2019s never had a weapon, and he (doesn\u2019t) own a weapon\u201d (quoted in Wilson 2016).<\/p>\n<p>His sister insisted that her brother had a lot to look forward to in life and would not have jeopardized it by challenging police. Not while he was waiting on word of his acceptance into the army, hoping to follow in the footsteps of his late father \u201cShorty.\u201d In his sister Melissa\u2019s words: \u201cHe is not really a fighter and he wouldn\u2019t have turned around and ruined everything because he was going into the army&#8221; (quoted in Wilson 2016).<\/p>\n<p>People who knew the young man agreed that they knew him as someone who worked hard at school. He was described as being serious in his approach. Alex Wettlaufer\u2019s sister-in-law put it like this: \u201cHe was the one no one worried about\u201d (quoted in Campbell 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Wettlaufer\u2019s brother noted that his younger sibling worked in a factory and had never had any run-ins with the law prior to being shot and killed by police. His brother described him as a quiet man who did not even use social media. He believed he had never touched a gun (Campbell 2016). According to his brother, who preferred not to be named: \u201cHe kept to himself and was never in trouble\u201d (quoted in Campbell 2016).<\/p>\n<p>A neighbor, Lilieth Rankine, who has known the Wettlaufer family for years, and lives in the same housing complex on Leslie north of Sheppard, remembers the victim fondly. In her view: \u201cHe\u2019s a good kid, went to school, finished school. I don\u2019t get it . . . What happened? Can you imagine what the community is going through?\u201d (quoted in Gillis 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Another family friend Diane Storm similarly remembered Alex Wettlaufer as focused with specific personal goals in life. In her words: \u201cHe was quiet, kept to himself \u2026 (he wanted) to get out of here, to get out of housing\u201d (quoted in Gillis 2016). Storms suggests, ominously, that the stigma and attention that young men in the community receive from police posed ongoing, real, and potentially fatal barriers, for young residents. She suggests: \u201cWhen you are trying to improve yourself, it doesn\u2019t help when you have this stigma\u201d (quoted in Gillis 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, Wettlaufer was a classmate and friend of Sammy Yatim, a young man infamously shot and killed by police while he was completely alone and isolated on a Toronto street car. The officer who killed Yatim, James Forcillo was convicted of attempted murder in a curious verdict (\u201cattempted murder\u201d even though he actually killed Yatim) following a rare case of a police officer in Canada actually being brought to trial for killing someone.<\/p>\n<p>The Wettlaufer family reported that their loved one was simply returning home after visiting his girlfriend at the time police confronted and killed him. His brother said he was walking through the park after taking his girlfriend to the subway station.<\/p>\n<p>Family friend Diane Storms was shaken by the killing. She asks: \u201cCan you imagine, talking to your child on the phone, then hearing gunshots? And then silence?\u201d (quoted in Gillis 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Ontario\u2019s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which probes incidents of death, serious injury, and allegations of sexual assault involving police, has been investigating the killing since Monday morning.\u00a0 Four investigators and three forensic investigators have been assigned to the case.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Campbell, Will. 2016. \u201cSIU Probes Death of 21-Year-Old Shot by Police in North York.\u201d Global News. <a href=\"http:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/2575972\/siu-investigating-after-man-injured-in-north-york-shooting\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/2575972\/siu-investigating-after-man-injured-in-north-york-shooting\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Gillis, Wendy. 2016. \u201cMan, 21, Dead after Police Shooting.\u201d Toronto Star.

in Canada have an alarming and dubious record of killing people who are apparently struggling with mental health issues. Late in the evening of Friday, March 4, 2016 the Toronto police, among the forces most notorious for executing people with mental illness, killed again. The victim, not identified by police, has been identified by family as Devon LaFleur, an Ottawa resident said to be struggling with mental health issues. According to family, who reported LaFleur missing on Friday, he had been suffering with bipolar disorder. The young man was shot multiple times and killed in front of a women\u2019s shelter where he had gone to visit a friend after travelling to Toronto.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), Ontario&#8217;s police watchdog, officers shot the 30-year-old man in front of a building on Bayview Avenue, south of Steeles Avenue East, in North York around 10 PM Friday evening. The victim was taken to Sunnybrook Hospital where he was pronounced dead.<\/p>\n<p>According to SIU spokesman Jason Gennaro a dozen officers were on the scene at the time LaFleur was shot and killed. According to the SIU three officers fired shots at the victim resulting in his death.<\/p>\n<p>LaFleur\u2019s aunt, Janet Page Andersen described her nephew as having a \u201clifetime of trouble\u201d and said he did not like taking his medication because it left him feeling \u201cdumbed down\u201d (a rather common concern people experience) (quoted in Doucette 2016). Andersen also described LaFleur as a \u201csensitive, joyful person\u201d who was loved by many people, despite the struggles he endured (quoted in Doucette, 2016). She reflected on her nephew in these terms: \u201cHe\u2019s a sensitive, joyful person and who loved nature and trusted people\u201d (quoted in Laucius 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Sadly emblematic of his caring nature, LaFleur may have been killed while trying to help a friend. According to Andersen, the family believes Devon LaFleur travelled to Toronto in the first place because he wanted to comfort a female friend who was staying in a women\u2019s shelter (Laucius 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Malcolm LaFleur, traveled to Toronto and spent Saturday scouring the area where police killed his son in a desperate effort to find out information about the lethal confrontation that left his son dead. According to Andersen: \u201cMy brother is devastated. Police aren\u2019t telling him anything\u201d (quoted in Doucette 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Unconfirmed reports by police suggested that LaFleur had earlier robbed a bank in Ottawa. His father had told police that he had no weapon but an air gun and made clear it was not a real firearm. According to Andersen: \u201cHe has had a hard time of it. But he had an air gun. He was not a dangerous man\u201d (quoted in Doucette 2016).<\/p>\n<p>A lover of nature and the outdoors, LaFleur had recently visited the West Coast and was looking to move to Vancouver Island with his father. Images he posted online showed photos of seals, seabirds, and himself hugging a massive tree. On his Facebook page he described himself as a \u201clost boy\u201d (Doucette 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Doucette, Chris. 2016. \u201cSIU Investigating after Man Shot by Cops.\u201d Toronto Sun.

Columbia","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/02\/28\/independent-investigations-the-failings-of-the-iio-and-police-oversight-in-british-columbia\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-2R","content":"<p>British Columbia is in the midst of a crisis involving police killings of civilians over the period of several years. The Independent Investigations Office, set up to address the use of lethal force by police in the province has in its few years of existence shown the perils and limitations of such would be oversight efforts. As in other cases issues of independence, and fortitude in the face of police backlash have come to the fore.<\/p>\n<p>There are currently only five police oversight agencies in Canada. This is a small minority in a country with ten provinces and three territories. The first such oversight agency was established in Ontario, the country\u2019s largest province, in 1990. Ontario\u2019s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is still viewed by many as the model such agency, nationally and, for some, globally, despite ongoing, well documented, structural limitations and continued interference and non-participation by police. The next oversight agency came almost a decade later when the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) was established in 2008. The Nova Scotia Serious Incident Response Team was set up in 2012, the same year that the IIO was established in British Columbia. In 2013 Manitoba set up the Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba.<\/p>\n<p>The Independent Investigations Office in British Columbia was created in response to recommendations resulting from two public inquiries into police involved killings, including the infamous police killing of Robert Dziekanski in which police lied publicly about events of the killing before a civilian video appeared to show police claims to be bold lies. The mandate of the IIO is to probe all police-involved incidents that result in death or serious harm. The IIO currently consists of 34 investigators. This includes team directors, forensics staff, affected-persons liaisons, and public accountability staff.<\/p>\n<p>The first few years of its existence has been rocky, to put it in its nicest possible light. The IIO began operations a year later than planned (Sept. 10, 2012) and over its first few years has suffered a range of problems and missteps. These include questions about its framework, low morale, high attrition, and ongoing concerns about how the office has investigated some of its cases. Allegations that chief civilian director Richard Rosenthal was harassing and bullying staff led to an investigation by the British Columbia government. Stunningly, 22 of the IIO\u2019s 50 employees quit or were fired in the first two years (Saltman 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The IIO staff recognize that the first few years have been a struggle and much work still needs to be done. The next chief civilian director of the IIO enters the position in 2017. According to current chief civilian director Richard Rosenthal: \u201cWe\u2019re four years old. Hopefully we\u2019re not sticking our fingers in electrical outlets, but we\u2019re still very young, we\u2019re still emerging, we\u2019re still developing. Nobody can say what this organization is really going to look like 10 years from now\u201d (quoted in Saltman 2016). Yet the newly developed directions in IIO training and practices raise real questions about its future as anything approaching an effective police oversight agency.<\/p>\n<p>The IIO has appeared to capitulate to criticism over cases that have found against police officers. Those cases have been responded to by a great deal of public propaganda by police officers, agencies, and supporters. This media flak by police associated sources has been effective in putting the office on the defensive. Senior director of investigations, Patrick Kennedy suggests: \u201cCivilian oversight is challenging because you have to look at it from a different perspective and a different paradigm\u201d (quoted in Saltman 2016).<\/p>\n<p>In response to police initiated criticisms the office has planned a new training program introduced in February 2016 involving the swearing in of seven new investigators. Under the new training program, investigators now complete a six- to eight-week induction and then spend three months training at the Justice Institute of B.C. Yet the Justice Institute is the police training institution in British Columbia. It is part of and central to policing in the province. Instructors are typically police officers, many of whom are currently active on the force. This is in no way independent training and it raises fundamental questions about investigators\u2019 relationships with and commitments to their instructors, the institution, and the police forces in British Columbia. Investigators will work cases for 12 to 18 months before they can act as primary investigators. While the IIO states its hope that the training will help the organization move toward one day being completely staffed by civilians, this raining program largely undermines this stated hope. Notably the \u201cindependent\u201d investigators have expressed satisfaction with the new arrangement.<\/p>\n<p>The records related to the cases within the Independent Investigations Office are quite telling: There have been 156 cases investigated by the IIO since the office opened in September 2012. Forty-four cases remain open. There have been 112 cases that have been closed. Of those closed cases, 48 resulted in reports to Crown counsel and 64 resulted in public reports exonerating the officers involved. An improbably low number of seven cases have seen any charges approved by the Crown. Of these, two cases resulted in stays of proceedings, two resulted in pleas, one resulted in an acquittal, and two are pending. The office has probed 29 officer-involved shootings. In 17 cases, the shootings were fatal while the rest of them resulted in serious harm. Between September 2014 and September 2015 alone there were 20 fatalities that the IIO was called to investigate. Twelve of these involved shooting deaths of civilians by police (Saltman 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Among the greatest current worries about the IIO has been the backlog of cases that has quickly built up in a short period of time. The office presently has 44 open cases, an incredible 10 of which are more than one year old. This has made things very difficult and painful for victims harmed by police and for families of victims killed by police. It has also put pressure on Crown prosecutors in making decisions about charges, already a rare circumstance in police involved killings. Incredibly, the IIO blames the backlog on the large increase in police involved killings (which the IIO was instituted to help reduce).<\/p>\n<p>There have also been concerns about the limited mandate and limited definitions of police involved harms. Currently domestic violence and sexual assaults by police are not included within the IIO mandate for investigations.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Saltman, Jennifer. 2016. \u201cB.C.&#8217;s Cop Watchdog Gets More Teeth: Dogged by Controversy, the IIO is Hiring More Investigators to Tackle Police Death Complaints.\u201d The Province.

No Evil: Surrey RCMP Refuse to Answer Questions about Killing of Hudson Brooks","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/02\/26\/speak-no-evil-surrey-rcmp-refuse-to-answer-questions-about-killing-of-hudson-brooks\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-2I","content":"<p>It says plenty about the protections afforded police who kill civilians in Canada that months after a killing even minimal details about the event are not released to public or media. Officers involved are shielded from public scrutiny. Media are not allowed to report the issue in a manner consistent with an open and democratic system. Loved ones are left to ask painful questions. And live with excruciating silence from the agencies involved and responsible for providing answers. This serves to protect the system and allows police agencies time to reconstruct events, and their stories, to suit their own interests.<\/p>\n<p>Seven months after Hudson Brooks, 20, was shot down in the street outside of an RCMP detachment in South Surrey, BC, the young man\u2019s family has received no answers and few insights into how or why their loved one came to be a victim of police violence. This despite repeated requests made to the RCMP and the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the province\u2019s police oversight body for information. This despite public appeals for disclosure from the RCMP, IIO, and local politicians, including two marches involving hundreds of supporters.<\/p>\n<p>What is known for sure is that Hudson Brooks was shot multiple times and killed by an RCMP officer or officers outside the force\u2019s South Surrey detachment. The IIO, in one of its few informational statements on the killing, has also confirmed that only a police service weapon was recovered at the scene. No other weapons were present. This is crucial because RCMP, as is often the case in police killings of civilians, initially suggested in media reports that there had been an exchange of shots between Brooks and the RCMP resulting in a gunshot wound to one officer. It now appears that the officer\u2019s injury was either self-inflicted or a result of friendly fire. Brooks was not even wearing a t-shirt at the time he was shot and killed. He had no weapon or place to hide it.<\/p>\n<p>Later police tried to claim that Brooks was suicidal. As in other recent cases in BC the RCMP sought to disparage and blame the victim (as if being suicidal could legitimize police killing someone\u2014only in that authoritarian culture of impunity). Brooks family and friends have been clear and consistent that the young man was happy, optimistic, with a bright future.<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly, neither Surrey\u2019s Mayor Linda Hepner nor local MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) for Surrey-White Rock Gordon Hogg have contacted the Brooks family whether to provide information or even to offer condolences. In the words of Jennifer Brooks, Hudson Brooks\u2019 mother: \u201cOur son was shot down in the streets of Surrey\u2014they haven\u2019t reached out to me. Where is the compassion? A young man loses his life and we\u2019re not contacted\u201d (quoted in Holmes 2016). A stunning lack of compassion, and basic human decency, which would certainly not be the case in the event of a police officer being killed by a civilian.<\/p>\n<p>Hudson Brooks\u2019 mother has lived with indescribable pain since her son was killed by RCMP officers early in the morning on July 18, 2015. Following the February 2016 march commemorating her son, Jennifer Brooks asked: \u201cEvery moment of everyday, I wonder, I get up, first thing I think of is what happened to Hudson? How did this escalate to the point that lethal force was used on my son, my unarmed son?\u201d (quoted in Beja 2016).<br \/>\nThere is much for the RCMP to answer for. Jennifer Brooks needs to know. The RCMP need to answer: \u201cI don\u2019t know why my unarmed son was shot multiple times. Why was lethal force used on Hudson? Why was he shot five to seven times? The silence is killing me. I have no answers. It\u2019s devastating\u201d (quoted in Chan 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Outrageously, the IIO points to an increase in officer-involved shootings, and the strain on resources they cause, as leading to a backlog of investigations that has left many families of victims of police violence seeking answers. According to Marten Youssef, spokesperson for the IIO: \u201cOur timeliness has suffered, and that is partly due to a spike in officer-involved shootings and officer-involved fatalities\u201d (quoted in Beja 2016). According to provincial records, between September 2014 and December 2015, there were 20 officer-involved fatalities, 12 were firearm-related, in British Columbia. That compares to one recorded fatal shooting by police in 2013 and three fatal shootings by police in 2012. The rise in killings of civilians by police in BC has led the IIO to hire more investigators to deal with the back-log. At public expense. Yet the activities of the IIO since their inception suggest that they remain largely toothless in holding killer cop accountable or in reigning in murderous forces in the province. In effect they offer no deterrence for killer cops and minimal real oversight.<\/p>\n<p>Jennifer Brooks suggests that the increase in police-involved shootings over the previous year points to a pressing need for better training. In her view: \u201cWhen there is someone in distress, the first thing to do is not shoot, not use lethal force\u201d (quoted in Beja 2016). In the words of Hudson Brooks\u2019 brother Beaudry: \u201cToo many don\u2019t have proper training and aren\u2019t ready for the position they are in. It leads to things like this. It shouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d (quoted in Chan 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Others would suggest that disarming the police in British Columbia might be a necessary step. Others call for ending the RCMP contracts in sub\/urban centers like Surrey.<\/p>\n<p>The silence and disengagement from public requests for answers is telling in the context of RCMP targeting of Surrey for increased policing and stated efforts toward community mobilization. Indeed the RCMP has long viewed Surrey as a site of force expansion and budgetary increase. They are banking on Surrey, and fear campaigns and moral panics targeting the city, in a context in which crime rates on the whole are declining consistently over years (with associated threats to police budgets). RCMP have established a public relations outreach officer in Surrey staffed by an officer who is also part of the RCMP campaign to gain a foothold in local communities by securing a faculty position in the local university, Kwantlen Polytechnic University, that enrolls the greatest proportion of Surrey post-secondary students. This has been central in efforts to recruit younger local residents while gaining access to informants, friends and family, in the neighborhoods of Surrey.<\/p>\n<p>Yet when families ask for answers about the RCMP killing their children, nothing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Beja, Tanya. 2016. \u201cRally Held for Man Fatally Shot by Surrey RCMP in 2015.\u201d Global News.

Sunday, January 24, 2016, David McQueen, quadriplegic and wheel-chair bound, was shot and killed by Calgary police. In the days following the shooting family and friends remembered and mourned the loss of a dedicated dad and friend with a great sense of humor who dealt with sever health problems, often alone and abandoned by public health services.<\/p>\n<p>Days after McQueen\u2019s killing by Calgary police, one of his two sons, Justin McQueen, remembered his father as a dedicated and loving father. He also noted that his dad had been suffering from extreme loneliness in the period preceding his being shot by police. Justin McQueen was three when his father suffered the spinal injury that left him quadriplegic.<\/p>\n<p>Justin McQueen recalled his dad: &#8220;He was an awesome dad. He didn&#8217;t act as though he had the accident. He played sports, he took us fishing\u201d (quoted in Wiebe 2016).<\/p>\n<p>According to the son the health issues and effects of the injury eroded his father\u2019s well-being over time. The situation degraded as his frustrations with unresponsive or underresponsive governements and public health care systems grew. Justin McQueen notes that his father was never provided with proper home care and his expressions of depression were ignored and untreated (Wiebe 2016). Justin McQueen recalls: &#8220;He was suffering. He was pretty much left in that house and screaming for help and nobody would help him&#8221; (quoted in Wiebe 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Among McQueen\u2019s closest friends was former NHL gaolie and longtime hockey broadcaster Kelly Hrudey. Hrudey sought out McQueen after reading a story about the Calgary father who was selling flowers from a cart to support his children after being paralyzed in a diving accident at Sikome Lake in 1994. McQueen\u2019s son, Justin, remembers Hrudey helping his family, recalling: \u201cKelly was my dad\u2019s best friend\u201d (quoted in Ho 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Hrudey remembers going to meet McQueen after reading his story: \u201cI went down there to visit anonymously. I didn\u2019t tell him who I am or what I do or anything. I just sat there and chatted with him. He had a great sense of humour, he loved to laugh, he was engaging\u201d (quoted in Ho 2016). From there an ongoing friendship developed. The two often got together to chat over lunch.<\/p>\n<p>McQueen\u2019s existing frustrations with government, healthcare services, and police intensified following the death of his beloved companion and service dog, Bear, earlier this month. This left McQueen feeling abandoned and alone according to those who knew him. Recalled Justin McQueen: &#8220;It was his absolute best friend. It was his only best friend&#8221; (quoted in Wiebe 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Upon hearing the news that McQueen had been shot and killed by police, Hrudey reflected on his friend\u2019s suffering and the need for access for mental health supports: \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. He was everything you wanted in a friend. Unfortunately, and we\u2019ve seen it with a lot of people with mental health issues, it can be completely debilitating. That\u2019s why we need to talk and find the help everybody needs\u201d (quoted in Ho 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Hrudey, whose daughter has dealt with mental health struggles, spoke of the need for social openness in addressing mental health: \u201cI just know that when Dave was well and functioning in society, he was just so proud of what he was accomplishing. Those were the good days. It\u2019s important we talk about mental health because Dave was more than what happened\u201d (quoted in Ho 2016).<\/p>\n<p>As is becoming all too frequent in the Canadian context, people struggling with mental health issues are subjected to often lethal intervention from police. Rather than supportive public health services, which are slow to come if at all, the response of police is quick and brutal. Of course an agency designed and organized for compliance and control, to putting down public signs of difference, are not at all suited to addressing mental health needs.<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Ho, Clara. 2016. \u201cFormer NHL Star Says Mental Health Discussion Could Have Saved Friend Who Died in Police Shootout.\u201d National Post.

McQueen","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/01\/31\/abandoned-by-the-system-killed-by-its-cops-the-police-shooting-of-david-mcqueen\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-2B","content":"<p>The Calgary man shot and killed by in the city\u2019s Huntington Hills neighborhood was 53-year-old David McQueen, a quadriplegic. McQueen was killed by Calgary police on Sunday, January 24, 2016, after what was reported as an hours long standoff. More than a dozen officers, including tactical team members, responded to the situation in the northwest neighborhood at around 4:40 PM. McQueen had experienced years of neglect, marginalization, and lack of support from various levels of government and the health care systems following a spinal injury suffered in an accident that left him quadriplegic in 1994. The victim had actively sought to improve his life situation and actively sought support from government and social service and health care agencies, with repeated lack of proper assistance over decades. Police shot McQueen immediately as the man exited his home in his wheelchair. Police said he had a handgun which had been fired in the neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>There was at least one person who was familiar with and cared about David McQueen\u2019s situation. Unfortunately she was barred by police from speaking with him in the moments before he was killed by police. McQueen\u2019s longtime caregiver, Isabelle Templeton, was talking over the phone with McQueen even as police surrounded his house. Templeton went to the scene and tried to talk with McQueen directly but was prevented by police. She heard the shots that killed McQueen while she was there on the street. In her words: &#8220;We heard the shots fired. We heard when we were sitting out on the street talking to the police officer. We didn&#8217;t know what was happening, but we knew something was going on&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Templeton related to reporters that McQueen used to call her his &#8220;Calgary mom.&#8221; She affirmed that the victim was a &#8220;very gentle and very caring man&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016). Templeton had no guess as to what, if anything, might have finally pushed McQueen over the line into more public expression of frustration. In her recollection: &#8220;Nothing like this ever came up. I just don&#8217;t know what triggered it&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016). At the same time she did acknowledge that McQueen had experienced a great deal of suffering with little to no support from public officials or the health care system. In her view: &#8220;Something did [break], but I think a lot of it was pain. Just pain. He was in so much pain&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016). In the end, \u201cHe just got kind of desperate\u201d (quoted in CBC 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Templeton acknowledged that McQueen was particularly frustrated with the healthcare system and the government, with apparent justification. She noted that he was stuck in a broken wheelchair and left alone without proper homecare. She also confirmed that McQueen was angry and distrustful of police based on the character of their interactions with him. Again she concluded: &#8220;I think he just got kind of desperate. I don&#8217;t know. I know I was getting desperate, just going to see him, and there was nothing you could do&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016).<\/p>\n<p>McQueen had appeared in a video for Easter Seals as part of one of the agency\u2019s campaigns. He appears in the video along with his beloved dog, his main companion. A spokesperson with Easter Seals Calgary, Stephanie Rosch, acknowledged that she knew of McQueen and confirmed that the video was filmed as part of a public-service announcement in 2009 (CBC 2016). Easter Seals Alberta CEO, Susan Boivin released a brief statement: &#8220;We are very saddened to hear the news of the passing of Dave McQueen. He was a former client of Easter Seals&#8217; Equipment and Support Services program, but we have not had any contact with him for many years&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016).<\/p>\n<p>McQueen&#8217;s had long documented the lack of support and what he experienced as mistreatment on behalf of the federal and provincial governments, and the healthcare system. His Facebook page contains numerous, lengthy posts detailing his experiences of injustice. McQueen describes how he suffered a spinal injury after diving into Calgary&#8217;s Sikome Lake in 1994, not realizing how shallow the man-made body of water actually is. He outlines his subsequent, unsuccessful attempts to sue the Alberta government over his injury (CBC 2016). Far from receiving support, several of McQueen&#8217;s publicly available Facebook postings suggest that he had come to believe that his computer and phone were being monitored by the authorities. McQueen posted that police had targeted him in the past and he expressed anger at how he had been treated by them.<\/p>\n<p>Alberta Liberal Party leader David Swann released a statement in response to the killing reporting that McQueen had &#8220;reached out frequently&#8221; to his constituency office. He noted that McQueen was always polite. Swann suggested that McQueen\u2019s story was one example of the numerous cases of people falling through the cracks in Alberta. Yet he does not seem to recognize his own possible role in that given the fact that McQueen had contacted his office frequently looking for assistance. Swann did say in his statement on McQueen: &#8220;He was suffering from an obvious, and serious, mental illness and it was often difficult to understand where he was coming from or how we could help.&#8221; According to Swann this is another example, if an extreme and violent one, of the great need for changes to the system. Wrote Swann: &#8220;David was also angry. Angry with the injury which all but paralyzed him, angry with a system he felt failed him, and angry with those who represented that system.&#8221; That includes police whom he felt had targeted and mistreated rather than helping him. This in a health care context requiring supportive rather than police services in the first place. Swann\u2019s statement concluded: \u201cMy thoughts are also with those, like my staff, who interacted with Mr. McQueen and are left, today, feeling they could have done more.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On January 15 McQueen posted that his main companion, his dog had died. The post goes on to outline his anger over Calgary police and a Calgary politician, as well as his neighbours who may have been responsible for police interactions with him. Templeton notes that the death of his dog was devastating because it increased his loneliness and lack of companionship. Incredibly, Templeton suggested that healthcare workers would not visit McQueen because of his dog.<\/p>\n<p>The police killing of David McQueen must be contextualized within the apparently growing trend in Canada of police involved killings of people experiencing mental health crises or distress. While statistics have not been kept in a systematic or reliable manner in Canada, between 2004 and 2014, the percentage of those cases of police killings of civilians involving people in mental crisis grew: they now account for about 40 percent of civilian shooting deaths at the hands of police (Firsthand 2016). Researchers for the documentary film Hold Your Fire report that in 2014, Toronto police answered 20,000 interactions involving people in mental crisis while Vancouver police say they respond to nearly 30,000 calls each year involving people experiencing mental illness (Firsthand 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Reasons for the apparent growth in police involved interactions, and lethal interactions, with people in mental health crisis are numerous and include economic crisis which spurs emotional crisis for more people; lack of proper and adequate community health services (and government cuts to services in the context of austerity regimes that target programs of need to the working class and poor for reduction or elimination), and; law and order and broken windows policing regimes that send police first to deal with any social disturbance. Even more, commentators like the producers of Hold Your Fire suggest that the real reason for more lethal actions undertaken by police in addressing people dealing with metal health crisis (and often police kill people upon first sight of the victim, often within one or two minutes of encounter) is improper, inadequate, outmoded, and regressive police training. This more than anything else (Firsthand 2016). We might suggest, however, that this is built into the very structure of the police as an institution of violence, repression, domination, and control.<\/p>\n<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) is investigating as is policy in Alberta when police are involved in incidents resulting in injuries or fatalities to civilians. Yet there is reason for concern about the investigation given statements made by Calgary police Chief Roger Chaffin following McQueen\u2019s killing by police. Chaffin said he expects the shooter&#8217;s motivation to be addressed as part of the investigation. The chief also, not surprisingly, stood by the actions of the officers responding to the incident despite the fact that no investigation has been conducted or completed. And despite the fact that the victim was quadriplegic and confined to a wheelchair.<\/p>\n<p>Chief Chaffin also reported that McQueen was known to police but did not suggest that this was related to any wrongdoing on behalf of the victim. Indeed he had to admit that none of the visits to McQueen\u2019s home involved anything of a criminal nature. Such statements about victims being known to police is a common tactic used by police in Canada to cast aspersions toward victims and to damage their reputation publicly, or suggest without evidence that they have a criminal history and are, therefore, less deserving of public sympathy. Often victims are known to police only because of a dubious stop by police without cause, as in cases of \u201ccarding,\u201d or because the victim actually called police for some type of support or assistance. In fact a search of court documents by reporters found that McQueen had no criminal record in Alberta. According to Chief Chaffin the Calgary Police Department is and was concerned with the well-being of their officers first and above all else.<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>CBC. 2016. \u201cCalgary Shooter Killed by Police Was Frustrated with Government, Health System, Says Caregiver.\u201d CBC News. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/calgary\/david-mcqueen-calgary-huntington-hills-shooter-killed-1.3418843\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/calgary\/david-mcqueen-calgary-huntington-hills-shooter-killed-1.3418843<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Firsthand. 2016. \u201cHold Your Fire.\u201d CBC News. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/firsthand\/episodes\/hold-your-fire\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/firsthand\/episodes\/hold-your-fire<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Calgary man shot and killed by in the city\u2019s Huntington Hills neighborhood was 53-year-old David McQueen, a quadriplegic.

the Gaff: The Police Murder of Striking Miner William Davis\u201d (Nova Scotia, 1925)<\/p>\n<p>Policing, throughout the history of state capitalist development, has always been directly connected with the protection of business and business interests. This connection has perhaps been especially clear in the context of resource and extractives industries. One sees it in defence of mining interests in which local, provincial, and federal police have been deployed, often lethally, to ensure the operations of mining companies and mining profits. The police killing of Ginger Goodwin and the Estevan Massacre are examples of this. At the same time companies have often created, as well, their own company police forces, private police to protect company property, ensure operations, and especially, control and regulate workers and bust their organizing efforts and unions. In various North American contexts, including for example in the steel towns of Pennsylvania, policing has developed as company policing with forces initiated by companies and\/or business associations. In Canada, the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company ran its own police force. So too did companies like the British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO) in Nova Scotia. In 1925 this police force was responsible for attacking a group of striking mine worker and killing miner William Davis, a father of ten (whose tenth child was born after his killing ad never knew its father).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Standing the Gaff: The Strike of 1925<\/p>\n<p>The coal mines of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia have been the sites of some of the most intense class struggles in the history of the Canadian state. The coal miners have shown some of the most militant and resolute examples of working class action ad solidarity in the face of aggression and brutality from massive mining companies. This has included facing lethal force from the mining companies and armed police forces.<\/p>\n<p>William Davis was born June 3, 1887 in Gloucestershire, England. He began working as a miner for the Dominion Coal Company Limited (DOMCO) on Cape Breton Island in 1905. He would work at the Number 12 Colliery in New Waterford, Nova Scotia until his murder at the hands of company police under direction of managers with the virulently antiunion British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO) which succeeded DOMCO in the coal fields. Upon taking over DOMCO mines in 1920 the larger BESCO immediately set up a systematic campaign to bust the union, District 26 of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Between 1920 and 1925, under the aggressive BESCO management, there were 58 strikes in the Sydney Coal Field.<\/p>\n<p>When the most recent contract expired on January 15, 1925 BESCO saw a chance to end the union. On March 2, 1925, BESCO cut off credit for food at BESCO company stores. This put many mining families in a situation of near starvation. On March 6 the union declared a strike with 12000 workers taking to picket lines. Only a small rump workforce was left to maintain the mines and prevent flooding. UMWA District 26 moved to full picketing on June 4 in response to the BESCO refusal to participate in arbitration.<\/p>\n<p>A few days into the strike, the company also decided to shut down the electricity and drinking water supply to the town of New Waterford. In response to the striking miners directly marched on the pumping station and power plant at Waterford Lake. There they actively expelled company workers in order to restart the utilities for the company homes in which miners lived while shutting them down for the company production facilities.<\/p>\n<p>On June 10 BESCO turned to its company police force to protect 30 scabbing company workers on their return to Waterford Lake. The plan was to go ahead with an effort to restart the water and electricity to company facilities that ran the mine pumps. The aim was to again cut off water to the families living in the town as a means of forcing the workers back to work by, essentially starving them out of the union. Indeed by June the situation of miners\u2019 families had become desperate.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after the strike began in March, a reporter with the Canadian Press interviewed Vice President of BESCO J.E. McLurg. In the interview McLurg offered his entirely arrogant, and now infamous assessment of how the company would defeat the striking workers. McLurg blustered: \u201cPoker game, nothing, we hold all the cards. Things are getting better every day they stay out. Let them stay out two months or six months, it matters not, eventually they will have to come to us. They can\u2019t stand the gaff.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This promise, and threat, that the company would squeeze the union until it broke would serve as a rallying cry of the striking miners to \u201cstand the gaff.\u201d It remains a rallying cry of workers in Nova Scotia and source of strength and solidarity on picket lines.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Murder of William Davis: June 11, 1925<\/p>\n<p>The morning of June 11, the company police carried out a campaign of harassment and intimidation carrying out thug patrols within the town. In response striking miners organized a protest in which around 3000 miners marched to the Waterford Lake pumping station and power plant. Their intention was to convince the scabbing company workers to support the strike.<\/p>\n<p>When the striking workers arrived at the plant at around 11 AM the company police were waiting for them. Without warning the armed police charged the crowd on horseback opening fire as they came. Many workers were injured in the fusillade of over 300 rounds fired into the crowd. William Davis was killed by police in the attack with many understanding that he had been shot deliberately by the officer whose bullet struck him directly in the heart. The striking workers rallied and were able to enter the facility as police retreated.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Turning the Tide: Solidarity and Militance in the Face of Murder<\/p>\n<p>In the days and weeks following the murder of Davis, miners stepped up their tactics and turned to direct action against company stores and other company properties in various communities throughout the Sydney Coal Field. Where the company was willing to take workers\u2019 lives, the workers would target what was most important to the company, its property and profits.<\/p>\n<p>While neither the provincial nor the federal government showed much concern over the company shooting of workers and murder of a striking miner, the simple threat to company property spurred them to immediately deploy the provincial police force and almost 2000 soldiers from the Canadian Army. This would be the second largest military deployment against an internal target in the history of the Canadian state, the largest being the deployment against indigenous and M\u00e9tis communities in the Northwest Rebellion in 1885. Of course, this would not be the last military mobilization against an internal target in Canadian state history with the military assault on the Mohawk communities during the \u201cOka crisis\u201d being a recent egregious case. For those who cling to an illusion that the liberal democratic government of Canada is a peaceful one that this serves as a stunning reminder that the Canadian government has at various points in its history used military force against civilian, non-combatants. For some this might stand as an example of state terrorism.<\/p>\n<p>Faced with the determination of the strikers and their families and the growing strength of the union, BESCO was compelled to settle the strike the strike in November and finally abandoned its attempts to break the union. The company also gave up its company stores, company housing, and other services. Indeed, BESCO never recovered from the strike action and faced with an energized and militant workforce eventually succumbed to company debt. In 1930 BESCO was taken over by the larger Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO). The miners of Cape Breton would continue as a militant force and the island have stood as a model of labor activism for generations.<\/p>\n<p>The strength and solidarity of the striking workers, their families, and their supporters and the commitment to direct action District 26 of the UMWA would emerge from the strike as one of the most militant, active unions on the continent. Their efforts and successes would stand as a testament to rank-and-file assertiveness and direct action.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Same Old Story: The Killers Go Free<\/p>\n<p>Charges against police for any killing of a civilian are rare in the Canadian state context. There is reluctance to hold defenders of property and accumulation accountable for doing what, at least in the final instance, they were organized to do. Rarer still are officers charged when they kill union members; in such case the role of policing in capitalist economies is even more immediately front and center and it would certainly be hypocritical of states to proceed. Yet in the case of the assault on UMWA member and the murder of William Davis, an officer did face a charge. This, perhaps because the officer belonged to a company rather than public force.<\/p>\n<p>BESCO police officer Joseph MacLeod was brought before a preliminary hearing in Sydney where he faced the charge of murder. In the end, though, not surprisingly, the Crown prosecutor dropped the charges against officer accepting the defense argument that the identity of the shooter could not be discerned and MacLeod should not be given unique treatment relative to the numerous other police officers involved the assault and shooting of Davis. A curious argument to say the least (raising a question about why the overall actions of police on that day were not addressed).<\/p>\n<p>For many in the area it apparently was common knowledge that William Davis was shot by BESCO police officer Harry Muldoon. The very day following the police shooting that took Davis\u2019 life, Harry Muldoon and his family were relocated to Boston, Massachusetts where they were able to live out their lives untroubled by the murder of William Davis.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Davis Day: A Legacy of Solidarity<\/p>\n<p>More than 5,000 mourners attended William Davis&#8217; funeral on June 14, making it the largest public presence for a funeral in the history of the province. District 26 of UMWA, showing the community care and solidarity at the heart of labor organizing established a fund to support the Davis family, his ten children and their mother, with monthly support. The date of the police murder of William Davis is still marked as a day of solidarity and working class memory in Nova Scotia. The first Davis Day was held on June 11, 1926 and saw miners across Cape Breton refuse to work. Instead they marched to the union hall in New Waterford before going to a nearby church for a memorial service in Davis\u2019 honor. Davis Day as an \u201cidle day\u201d spread quickly being observed by miners across the province, who refused to work on the day. In 1969 Davis Day became a paid provincial holiday.<\/p>\n<p>New Waterford established Davis Square in 1985. The Davis Wilderness Trail was established in 1996 and follows the original route taken by the striking miners on June 11, 1925 to the pumping station and power plant at Waterford Lake. The ringing words on the Davis Memorial at Davis Square proclaims simply: \u201cStanding the Gaff.\u201d<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>\u201cStanding the Gaff: The Police Murder of Striking Miner William Davis\u201d (Nova Scotia, 1925) Policing, throughout the history of state capitalist development, has always been directly connected with the protection of business and business interests.

to Protect Property: Police and Vigilantes in the Reesor Siding Strike Massacre of 1963 (Activists Killed by Cops Series)<\/p>\n<p>Policing in Canada has at its roots the protection of property and profit. The police at all levels have readily resorted to violence, including lethal force, to protect the interests of private property holders and businesses. They have also worked to provide a context in which property holders and business owners have been able to inflict often lethal violence against working people and the poor, especially against labor organizers and union members, with impunity and often in the sheltering presence of the police themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Too often if police violence against activists in the Canadian context is considered at all it is viewed as a relic, something confined to the early histories of colonial or industrial strife, remnants of say the less enlightened 1910s or 1930s, eras marked by robber barons and resource giants. Yet labor struggles in all periods of Canadian history have shown the willingness of police to deploy extreme violence against unionists and to support such violence against unionist by others.<\/p>\n<p>The strike at Reesor Siding in 1963 stands as one of the signal and bloodiest labor struggles in Canadian history even if it and the town it is named for have been unduly forgotten. It would culminate in a vicious attack on striking workers by vigilantes accompanied by, and facilitated by, local police, with the shooting of 11 union members, three of whom were killed in the assault.<\/p>\n<p>The 1963 strike involved fifteen hundred members of the Lumber and Sawmill Workers Union (LSWU), Local 2995 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America who worked at the Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company. Issues of concern included a proposed wage freeze and an attempt by the company to extend the woodworkers work week to seven days a week over the next two months in order to meet a company quota.<\/p>\n<p>Among the other suppliers of pulp wood to the mill were independent settler farmers who supplied about one-quarter of the company\u2019s annual input. These settler farmers, who sold wood to supplement their incomes, were asked to stop their sales of pulp wood to the company to put additional pressure on the mill and strengthen the workers\u2019 position.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the strike, the union organizers attempted to demonstrate to the farmers that the strike against a common antagonist Spruce Falls would benefit both farmers and workers. The union even offered to feed and give firewood to any farmers who were affected by the strike (Kapuskasing Times 2013).<\/p>\n<p>Settler farmers, forgoing solidarity for narrow self-interest refused to halt operations to support the strikers and improve their bargaining position. A strike at the New York Times, a main purchaser of the mill\u2019s pulp further reduced the striking woodcutters\u2019 leverage. In retaliation for the scabbing operations of the settler farmers, striking workers sabotaged the settlers\u2019 stacked lumber piles, destroying some lumber and making it unusable against their own efforts.<\/p>\n<p>The growing tensions in the community came to a head on February 10, 1963. At midnight of that day a shipment of 600 cords (2200 m\u00b3) of lumber was scheduled to be loaded onto waiting railcars for transport to the company. Twenty settler farmers were present to defend the lumber and they were openly ready and prepared to use any levels of violence deemed necessary to do so. Around 20 officers of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) were also present at the loading station in order to protect the lumber and presumably the angry settler farmers as well. The settler farmers and OPP officers formed what has been called a \u201cbattalion\u201d against the strikers (Darrah 2015). A grouping of an estimated 400 workers had determined to impede the shipment but they were, as has generally been the case in labor disputes in Canada, unarmed.<\/p>\n<p>The police put up a simple chain line to keep the striking workers away from the shipment. As workers moved past the chain and continued toward the pulp wood several of the farmers, who police knew to be armed, stepped out from their hiding place at a hut by the tracks and began shooting before the union members indiscriminately with no response from the police whose actions, in fact, allowed the ambush to occur. Eleven union members were shot. Brothers Iren\u00e9e and Joseph Fortier along with Fernand Drouin were killed. Eight others were wounded: Harry Bernard, Ovila Bernard, Joseph Boily, Alex Hachey, Albert Martel, Joseph Mercier, L\u00e9o Ouimette, and Daniel Tremblay.<\/p>\n<p>It has long been understood that the OPP officers were aware that the farmers were armed the night of the assault. It was also well known within the community, and would certainly have been known to police that the farmers had been worked up to a murderous pitch against the striking workers. The mayor of nearby Kapuskasing, Norman Grant, was quoted in the Globe and Mail, Canada\u2019s national newspaper, saying, &#8220;These settlers are getting so desperate they are going to go into the bush with guns and shoot anyone who tries to interfere with their cutting.&#8221;[1] None other than Donald MacDonald, leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP), would later report that affidavits after the massacre showed that the police knew that the farmers had brought firearms with them that night, but did not take any precautions to ensure the weapons were not used against the workers. Indeed it was the OPP who notified the farmers that the workers were coming, allowing them to prepare their ambush (Kapuskasing Times 2013).<\/p>\n<p>The response of the provincial government was to send an additional 200 OPP officers to the area, the same force that had been complicit in the massacre. The Ontario Ministry of Labour intervened to settle the dispute, with the workers having to return to work under the conditions of their old contract only a week after the killings. Joseph Laforce, President of Local 2995 and the executive board of LSWU had accepted the agreement only under threat by the Government of Ontario that it was poised to legislate the workers back to work if they refused this solution (Kapuskasing Times 2013). The strike had gone on for only 33 days.<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly, 254 union members were charged with rioting, there had been no riot by workers, and held temporarily in the former Monteith POW Camp (which is now the site of a penitentiary) (Kapuskasing Times 2013). They were released on bail posted by the union but in subsequent trials 138 union members were found guilty of illegal assembly and the union was made to pay $27,600 in fines.<\/p>\n<p>All twenty settler farmers present at the siding the night of the shootings were charged. In total an arsenal of five .22 caliber rifles, three 12 gauge shotguns, two .30-30 caliber rifles, two Lee\u2013Enfield rifles, a .30-06 caliber rifle, and a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver were confiscated.<\/p>\n<p>The case against the farmers was heard in October 1963 in the nearby town of Cochrane, before Supreme Court of Ontario Chief Justice McRuer. Astonishingly, but showing the real face of class justice in the Canadian context, following a preliminary hearing, the seven-man jury dismissed the charges of non-capital murder after three days of deliberations. Paul-Emile Coulombe, L\u00e9once Tremblay, and H\u00e9ribert Murray were charged with firearms violations in relation to the ambush, which resulted in fines of a mere $150 to each of them, a pittance in comparison to the fines levied against the union and given he atrocity of the actions the men had been involved in.<\/p>\n<p>Some suggest at the Reesor Siding Massacre and the murders of the three workers contributed to provincial arbitration and an improvement of working conditions for bush workers across Northern Ontario (Darrah 2015). It apparently did much to build solidarity among workers in the region.<\/p>\n<p>A monument to the murdered workers was placed on the site as well as a provincial historical marker. Over the years anti-unionists have made threats on the memorial. Several folk songs have been written about the massacre including one by Stompin Tom Connors. Ironically, in the years after the massacre any children of farmers left the farms to go work in the bush for Spruce Falls.<\/p>\n<p>It is often said and believed, by criminologists as by members of the general public, that the police are neutral arbitrators who serve and protect without taking sides in social conflicts, particularly those involving the private realm of industry. Yet throughout Canadian history we see the fundamental, and consistent, class character of policing as mechanism of capital accumulation, profit, and property relations (and relations of ownership and control of production). The Reesor Siding Massacre shows yet another example, this time of complicity in mass murder and direct relations with those responsible for killing (even alerting them of their victims\u2019 impending arrival and unwillingness to disarm the assailants ahead of time).<\/p>\n<p>The Reesor Siding Massacre also offers an important if forgotten aspect of the history of settlerism I the Canadian context. It is one that bears further research.<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Darrah, Dan. 2015. This Labour Day Let\u2019s Remember Five Forgotten Stories of Struggle.
