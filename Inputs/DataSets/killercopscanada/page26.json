Even where charges are pursued in court killer cops are almost never found guilty by the system they uphold, protect, and service. The verdict in the case of York Regional Police officer Remo Romano who killed pedestrian Natasha Carla Abogado (18) on the evening of February 12, 2014 while speeding offers yet another sad case in point. On September 2, 2016 a jury declared Romano not guilty of dangerous driving causing death. Their decision came after seven hours of deliberations.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Killing of Carla Abogado by Remo Romano<\/p>\n<p>Detective-Constable Remo Romano (44) was driving an unmarked pickup truck at an incredible speed of 115 km\/h, nearly double the 60 km\/h speed limit, when he struck Abogado, killing her. The young victim was thrown approximately 80 meters and was declared dead on the scene in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, Ontario. Notably, Constable Romano did not have his sirens or lights activated (Yuen 2016a). At the time he hit and killed Abogado, Romano was part of a surveillance team, Project Litterbox, investigating a series of non-violent commercial break-ins involving major Canadian capitalist enterprises such as Shopper\u2019s Drug Mart, according to details provided to the jury (Hasham 2016). They were said to be stealing\u2026perfume (Mandel 2016). Far from being a threat or crucial pursuit situation, Romano had simply fallen behind the other officers in his team and was speeding to catch up to them when he struck Abogado who had just gotten off a bus on her way home.<\/p>\n<p>Crown prosecutor Perlmutter informed the jury that the surveillance operation Romano was involved in at the time he killed Abogado was only involved in intelligence gathering and was by no means dangerous nor urgent (Hasham 2016). Certainly it was not a matter of life and death urgency that he catch up with his team (or he might not have been so lax in falling behind in the first place). According to Perlmutter: \u201c(He was) not entitled to drive at those speeds, to put himself in position where he did not have the time and space to respond to a jaywalker. This did not justify the risk to the public\u201d (quoted in Hasham 2016). And we might stress again that this was an operation in which the police were providing essentially private security services for Canadian capital. Revealing once more that essential and unwavering connection.<\/p>\n<p>The Crown\u2019s collision reconstruction expert informed the court that a car going more than 80 km\/h would likely have hit Abogado but at a slower speed, that car could have been able to stop or swerve to avoid impact instead. It was also noted that anyone jaywalking would have estimating oncoming vehicles traveling at the speed limit of 60 km\/h (Hasham 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Blaming the Victim<\/p>\n<p>Romano cynically blamed the victim on the stand stating: \u201cShe made the choice to step out in front of my vehicle\u201d (quoted in Yuen 2016a). An incredibly callous and self-serving assertion.<\/p>\n<p>Defense lawyer Bill MacKenzie also blamed the victim for jaywalking rather than using a crosswalk. He cynically called the killing a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and went on to blame her clothing choice (quoted in Hasham 2016). Even more MacKenzie used the old ploy of tempting a jury to feel sorry for an officer who would be disgraced by being convicted. He further suggested that there is a disjuncture between the identity of officer and the identity of criminal as if the two are mutually exclusive. And he slyly suggested to the jury that they did not want to be responsible for effecting such an outcome for a supposed community servant. In his words: \u201cAt what speed does he go from being a police officer serving his community to a convicted criminal?\u201d (quoted in Hasham 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Constable Romano suffered panic attacks and was prescribed the anti-anxiety medication later found in his bag at the site of the crash (Mandel 2016). He claimed it was \u201cjust there for security\u201d and insisted he had not taken any the night of the crash (Mandel 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A Family Devastated<\/p>\n<p>This decision comes in Romano\u2019s second trial. At an earlier trial in May, a jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict following two days of deliberations (Hasham 2016). Abogado\u2019s family, who sat through both trials left the courtroom without common following the September verdict.<\/p>\n<p>Carla Abogado\u2019s father, Guillermo Abogado, expresses only disappointment with the verdict that has left the family further devastated. He worries for what the decision will men for other victims\u2019 families as well. In his words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy whole family was very upset, we were expecting a guilty verdict. From Day 1 until now, it\u2019s very hard for us. The jury are allowing the police officers to use 115 km\/h on a busy street, near a hospital and subway station. I hope they have a conscience because it may happen again now. They\u2019ve set a precedent. They\u2019re allowing every police officer to do it again.\u201d (quoted in Yuen 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>The dissatisfaction with the court system is echoed by Paula Abogado, Carla\u2019s sixteen-year- old younger sister. From her perspective: \u201cWith this, we were trying to find a little bit of closure, but now what are we going to get out of this? Every time there\u2019s a trial we always get a reminder and it just brings us back to this place where we have no time to heal\u201d (quoted in Yuen 2016b). Sadly this is the disappointing outcome experienced by almost all families of victims of police violence in Canada who expect justice through the court system.<\/p>\n<p>Guillermo Abogado noted the difficulties and frustrations that families face when the killer of their loved one is a police officer. As he reflects, painfully: \u201cWe\u2019re fighting a police officer, they have lots of support. I felt it was scripted. He faced the jury and was crying to get the sympathy of the jury. Maybe they felt it worked last time, so they\u2019ll do it again\u201d (quoted in Yuen 2016b). History in such cases in the Canadian context shows they do.<\/p>\n<p>The Abogado family is also pursuing a $2.2 million civil suit against the York Regional Police.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>The verdict while not shocking given the historic lack of accountability for police officers who kill civilians did seem to skirt all reason. As the Crown prosecutor Philip Perlmutter laid out, Romano ignored the obvious and foreseeable risks of driving at such speeds through a residential area with both a seniors\u2019 center and bus stop en route (Hasham 2016). According to Perlmutter: \u201c(Abogado) died on account of a fatal combination of Mr. Romano\u2019s excessive speed and lack of attention\u201d (quoted in Hasham 2016). In support of business interests. And once again a killer cop is let off the hook despite what logic dictates.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Hasham, Alysha. 2016. \u201cYork Cop Acquitted in 2014 Death of Jaywalker.\u201d <em>Toronto Star<\/em>.

Montsion\u2019s Somali-Canadian Problem: The Killing of Abdirahman Abdi","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/09\/constable-montsions-somali-canadian-problem-the-killing-of-abdirahman-abdi\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-4I","content":"<p>Constable Daniel Montsion is one of the Ottawa Police Service officers who killed Abdirahman Abdi, a Somali-Canadian man well known and cared for in his neighborhood. Numerous witnesses to the police killing of Abdi have reported that the officers involved over-reacted with extreme violence against the man despite appeals from neighbors not to hurt the man who struggled with mental health issues which neighbors were aware of. So it is rather disturbing to find out that Constable Montsion was policing a neighborhood of Somali migrants despite having previously, by his own admission, \u201cpanicked\u201d during a violent takedown of another Somali-Canadian man in the city.<\/p>\n<p>News of this previous incident of panic in the presence of a Somali-Canadian man was released as part of a court decision acquitting Abdullah Adoyta, (25) on gun charges following an arrest by Montsion. Notably, the judge in that case raised concerns about the reliability of Constable Montsion\u2019s sworn testimony regarding the 2014 police raid that resulted in the arrest of Adoyta. Ontario Superior Court Justice Marc Labrosse noted that Montsion\u2019s story conflicted both with Adoyta\u2019s account and with the testimony of a senior officer on key points (Dimmock 2016).<\/p>\n<p>During the raid and arrest of Adotya, Montsion was one of seven Ottawa police officers to attend the apartment on a raid of supposed gang members. Montsion reported grabbing Adotya\u2019s forearms, raising them up. He claimed that as he did so the man\u2019s raised shirt revealed the silver grip of a semi-automatic handgun. In response to this Montsion said he \u201csort of panicked\u201d and began kneeing the young man while taking him to ground on the floor of the apartment. Montsion said that in this he did not see the gun fall out and only found it after moving the man while on the floor. He specifically said that he saw the gun only after the man was in handcuffs.<\/p>\n<p>Judge Labrosse did not accept Montsion\u2019s stated version of events. On one hand, his story conflicted with the testimony provided by Sergeant Mark MacMillan. MacMillan reported grabbing the gun before Adoyta had been arrested. Notably MacMillan said that he was so fearful for officer safety that he grabbed the gun with bare hands rather than use gloves to preserve DNA and fingerprint evidence (Dimmock 2016). The judge rejected this also not accepting that officer safety in that case overrode the necessity to preserve evidence.<\/p>\n<p>Even more, Labrosse found that the \u201cmanner in which (Adoyta) was taken down, with Const. Montsion raising Mr. Adoyta\u2019s arms in the air and seeing the handgun in Mr. Adoyta\u2019s waistline is difficult to both understand and accept\u201d (quoted in Dimmock 2016). The judge found further that Montsion and MacMillan provided opposed views of the takedown of Adotya. While Montsion claimed a struggle, MacMillan suggested there was none, even telling the court that Montsion held the handgun casually. According to Labrosss: \u201cThis is inconsistent with the evidence that Const. Montsion was struggling with Mr. Adoyta\u201d (quoted in Dimmock 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Judge Labrosse concluded as well that Montsion had confused the large, silver Gucci belt buckle worn by Adoyta with a pistol grip. While Montsion claimed he saw a silver grip the grip of the gun provided by police was actually black. Montsion made no mention of a belt buckle.<\/p>\n<p>For his part Adoyta reported that he did not reside in the apartment targeted by police but had merely been invited there by a tenant. He said that he complied with police but was grabbed by Montsion and knocked to the side of a couch. The officer yelled \u201cgun\u201d around ten seconds later and then started kneeing and punching him. It was only then, wth Montsion pulling his hair, that Adoyta saw a gun on the floor some foot and a half away from him (Dimmock 2016). He reported a real need to protect himself from Montsion, not resisting arrest.<\/p>\n<p>Labrosse noted that Adoyta had not seen a gun on the floor before the police entered. Adotya did not suggest that the gun was planted by police. He did ask police to do a fingerprint test to show his innocence with regard to possession of the gun.<\/p>\n<p>Others might wish to ask such a question of planted \u201cevidence.\u201d So too will people have to decide whether to ask about the circumstances of panic in Constable Montsion\u2019s aggressive arrests of two Somali-Canadian men and what role racism or anti-Somali sentiment might have played in his behavior toward those men.<\/p>\n<p>Constable Montsion is currently under investigation by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the oversight agency that investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in Ontario. Constable Dave Weir is also under investigation in the killing of Abdirahman Abdi.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Dimmock, Gary. 2016. \u201cCop in Abdi Case Involved in Previous Violent Arrest of Somali-Canadian.\u201d <em>The Sun<\/em>.

Illusions of Independence: IIO Director Steps Down and Calls for More Police Involvement","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/07\/ending-illusions-of-independence-iio-director-steps-down-and-calls-for-more-police-involvement\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-4F","content":"<p>The problems of oversight of police in Canada have been consistently observed in every oversight agency in the country. Perhaps nowhere have these problems, and the limitations of institutional oversight structures in the Canadian context been more clearly revealed in a short period of time than in the example of the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia. Less than four years in existence the agency, founded in direct response to the infamous killing by police of Robert Dziekanski at Vancouver International Airport in 2007, in a case in which police lied about the killing until civilian video surfaced, has been beset by a range of troubles. These include a lack of capacity even to get police to file reports on time or refrain from watching news reports before filing reports, to the involvement of officers at the Justice Institute of British Columbia in training investigators to investigate police. All of this calls into question the independence, authority, and competence of the IIO and leaves victims and their families, as well as social commentators, questioning the organization.<\/p>\n<p>Now the exiting director is, incredibly, calling for more, not less police involvement in and direction of the organization. The embattled director of the provincial oversight body, Richard Rosenthal, announced in September 2016 that he is leaving his position four months before his term ends, effective September 7. Rosenthal was appointed as the civilian director of the IIO with its founding in 2012. On his way out the door he has given a gift to police, and perhaps another nail in the IIO coffin as far as independence is concerned.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Curious Claims: Calling for More Cops<\/p>\n<p>In particular Rosenthal has argued for greater discretion in the hiring of former police officers. Currently the IIO is restricted from hiring any person who has been a police force member in BC within the last five years. Rosenthal wants that restriction abolished (Rosenthal 2016). This has not prohibited the IIO from being trained by officers at the JIBC or hiring officers from outside the province. Without explanation, or regard for the implications of having officers investigating their friends and colleagues, Rosenthal suggests that former officers are the only means by which to provide training to civilians. This is a curious claim to say the least for someone who is leaving the IIO to study for his PhD in criminology. Surely there are many criminologists and forensic scientists who could train civilian investigators. Rosenthal\u2019s claim speaks to the dependence on and over-regard for police exemplified in the IIO.<\/p>\n<p>Rosenthal has also argued that the IIO director needs more discretion in choosing what cases to take to investigation. Right now the IIO mandate calls for investigation of all events in which death or serious injury is caused by a police officer. This means that the investigation delivers the assessment of officer culpability (though officers are virtually never found culpable or responsible regardless of the circumstances or evidence). More discretion would lead to cases being overlooked or not being pursued, even where an investigation might well be warranted. This is particularly so if Rosenthal\u2019s other recommendation for more officer involvement in the agency were followed.<\/p>\n<p>The issue of hiring former police to the supposedly civilian agency is not strictly academic. It has been a point of contention in the history of the IIO. Indeed, in 2015 the IIO was investigated for allegations of bullying and harassment related to the agency\u2019s hiring of former officers (Meuse 2016). As a result 17 investigators and five non-investigative staff exited the IIO within only its first 28 months of operation (Meuse 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Rosenthal as struggled to explain this. Upon leaving he has suggested:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the beginning, we were having challenges. We did not have alignment in vision and values of the organization. And unfortunately when you\u2019re the leader of the organization, you take heat from people who don&#8217;t share that vision and who need to leave. [But] the good news is that now we are in a place where we have a strong executive that understands the importance of independence.\u201d (quoted in Meuse 2016)<\/p>\n<p>Yet this so-called independence has never been a hallmark of the IIO. Since the beginning of operations in 2012, the IIO has worked under a memorandum of understanding drafted in consultation with police chiefs from across British Columbia (Meuse 2016). Strangely, while suggesting a respect for independence Rosenthal has claimed that \u201cthe document has been excellent in allowing the IIO to work collaboratively with police forces\u201d (Meuse 2016). The question always remains, \u201cCan an independent body simultaneously be a collaborator?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Comply or..Well, Nothing<\/p>\n<p>One problem remains that there is no actual mechanism to compel police to respect IIO authority or act according to the needs and demands of the investigation rather than the interests of police forces and associations. As in other oversight agencies in Canada, police in BC are able to obstruct, ignore, interfere with, or disregard investigators and investigations. A recent IIO report itself has concluded that police routinely refuse to file reports in a timely manner after an incident of harm to civilians and often do so only after watching news reports. According to Rosenthal: \u201cThat\u2019s not happening, on a systemic basis. It\u2019s a huge problem as far as ensuring the integrity of investigations. We need the government to step up and create regulations in order to ensure that we&#8217;re able to do our job in an effective manner\u201d (quoted in Meuse 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>None of this will be secured by having more police involved in the agency. Rosenthal\u2019s statements, really an appeal for police involvement and the end of even limited \u201cindependence,\u201d upon leaving should be a warning sign for all families and friends of victims who are seeking answers or some accountability and for all civilians in British Columbia. Particularly in a context in which police killings of civilians are increasing in the province.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Meuse, Matt. 2016. \u201cIIO Director Richard Rosenthal Steps Down 4 Months Early.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

problems with oversight of police, and investigations into police use of force against civilians are numerous and have been extensively documented and discussed within this project. Indeed even state bodies such as the Ombudsperson of Ontario have found, documented, and reported on the failings of police oversight agencies and practices. In addition to repeated counts of interference with and obstruction of investigations and harassment of investigators by officers and police associations, one of the recurring issues has been the lack of cooperation with investigations by officer and the withholding of required information by officers in investigations.<\/p>\n<p>A new report by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) of British Columbia, released publicly on August 31, 2016, highlights the dubious behavior of officers of the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) during an investigation into the shooting and killing of a man who reportedly stabbed several people on a downtown street. The IIO investigators specifically criticized police for failing to file timely written reports of critical incidents immediately after the incident occurred. In addition the report noted that officer accounts were tainted not only by delays but by their having watched television reports of the incident before filing their accounts. The IIO concluded that these problems were \u201cwidespread\u201d among officer in British Columbia.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Officers Fail to Comply<\/p>\n<p>The IIO noted the significance of timely accounts following police use of force. In the words of the IIO release: \u201cSuch reports are essential to ensure the integrity of criminal and administrative investigations and reviews of officer decisions to use deadly force or force likely to cause significant injury\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2016). On the matter of police viewing of news media stories about the incident they were involved in the IIO concluded: \u201cAs such, the statements of these officers were impacted by evidence separate and apart from their own recollections and memories of the events\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2016). In this case the IIO had to rely on the memories of civilian witnesses (who may or may not have felt intimidated by police).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>No Accountability<\/p>\n<p>It is notable that while the IIO report was highly critical of the actions of two officers involved in the killing and their failure to write up reports immediately and without media influence, the IIO cleared the officers of wrongdoing. This is an all too familiar contradiction in police oversight and shows the limits (virtual non-existence) of current oversight practices and agencies.<\/p>\n<p>Significantly, the IIO investigators reported that the failure to file a timely report was not an isolated incident limited to the VPD. In fact it is identifiable practice in other forces, including, most notably, the RCMP, the force that provides provincial policing and municipal policing services in many municipalities across the province (in addition to being the federal force). According to the IIO report:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe IIO has become aware of a pattern of problems with respect to subject officers involved in critical incidents in British Columbia failing to prepare timely duty to accounts or notes of their involvement in incidents. These problems have been identified with respect to multiple files involving not just the Vancouver Police Department, but also the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and two other municipal police agencies.\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2016)<\/p>\n<p>It is a problem of police oversight and investigations into police harm of civilians that there are few mechanisms to compel police to comply and act in the mannered required by the investigation. These could be, but are not, treated as chargeable offenses. Furthermore, it is a problem that the filing of reports in a timely manner, and under specified conditions are not viewed as part of the incident of harm in question but as separate, discreet moments. The result is that wrongdoing as identified in the IIO report are not considered when assessing whether or not police engaged in wrongdoing when harming someone. The filing of reports, etc. should be considered as part of the incident and considered when assessing the actions of police over the course of the incident of harm under consideration.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly, while not finding against the officers involved, the IIO has taken the atypical step of moving to file its own complaint with the Office of the Police Complaints Commissioner about police actions. There is little reason to believe that this step will result in anything approaching accountability for the officers involved. It is also telling that the IIO has not named the officers involved in such obstruction publicly. It is also perhaps ironic that forces that have adopted a \u201ccomply or die\u201d approach to policing on a customary basis, resulting in much taking of civilian lives in the province, are so cavalier i.e. non-compliant) about complying with investigations when it affects them as respondents.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>CBC News. 2016. \u201cInvestigation into Police Shooting Raises Concerns.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

The killing took place in the town of St-Cyrille-de-Wendover, near Drummondville, about 115 kilometers northeast of Montr\u00e9al after two SQ officers apparently responded to a call at approximately 9:45 PM. Police report that the man and a woman, who apparently were in a non-marital relationship, had supposedly argued over ownership of a cell phone. The woman was said to be in a neighbor\u2019s house at the time police arrived. Police have also reported that when they arrived the man was holding a knife. Neighbors have reported hearing two shots fired. The woman\u2019s eight-year-old daughter and father were also at the scene.<\/p>\n<p>Six investigators with the Bureau des enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendantes (BEI), the Bureau of Independent Investigators, which investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in Qu\u00e9bec, are investigating the killing of the as yet unnamed victim. Notably, and alarmingly, the Montr\u00e9al police department is also working on the investigation. This violate principles of independence and autonomy in investigations of police wrongdoing and once more involves police investigating police (or interfering with investigations of police).<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>A 41-year-old man was shot and killed by officers of the Qu\u00e9bec provincial police, the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec (SQ), on Friday, August 26, 2016.

is a Terror Bomb Something Else?: On the RCMP Killing of Aaron Driver","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/08\/26\/when-is-a-terror-bomb-something-else-on-the-rcmp-killing-of-aaron-driver\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-4v","content":"<p>The killing of Aaron Driver by RCMP on August 10, 2016, in what police have claimed was an anti-terrorism sting has raised a number of serious questions about the nature of the RCMP operation, the police relationship with Driver beforehand, the timing of the police intervention, and the seriousness of the threat, if any, actually posed by Driver. The only information circulating publicly is based on the word of the police and the lone known witness the cabbie, Terry Duffield, called by Driver before the police ambush and in whose taxi Driver was killed by an RCMP bullet.<\/p>\n<p>RCMP claim to have intervened against Driver on the basis of a tip by the FBI that someone in Canada was planning an imminent terrorist attack in a public space. Yet their actions in approaching and killing Driver call into question the response taken to what police are claiming was a real, imminent, threat.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What Manner of Terror Bomb Explodes Killing No One?<\/p>\n<p>Police initially intimated that Aaron Driver had been killed by a bomb that he held and which he detonated upon seeing police approach the cab he was sitting in. Yet an autopsy released by Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), who are investigating the actions of the RCMP has apparently revealed that Driver was killed by police bullets. The autopsy showed that several police bullets struck Driver, piercing vital organs (Rieti 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Aaron Driver\u2019s father, Wayne Driver, reported that his son was killed by a police bullet that struck his heart. The supposed bomb he carried could not have killed him. According to Wayne Driver: \u00a0\u201cIt was the police officer\u2019s bullet that killed him. The bomb that exploded he could have walked away from with minor to severe injuries they said\u201d (quoted in Bell 2016a).<\/p>\n<p>According to police Driver was even allowed to leave the vehicle after the explosion. In the words of RCMP Deputy Commissioner Mike Cabana: \u201cSubsequent to that he came out of the cab and was standing up and was not following the direction that was provided\u201d (quoted in Bell 2016b). And police had no opportunity to act before then given the imminent peril they claim?<\/p>\n<p>This raises one rather large, fundamental, question. How could a bomb that was supposed to pose an imminent threat to broad public safety not be powerful enough to kill even the single person holding it on his lap? Now it is possible that Driver simply messed up in making it. It is also possible, especially given questions raised below about the police actions and the timing of their intervention that they had some knowledge of the bomb beforehand and had reason to expect that the bomb would do little or no harm. Perhaps because police had designed it and helped prepare it, as a dud, in much the manner they did for John Nuttall and Amanda Korody in entrapping that unfortunate couple.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Danger to Whom?: Why Not Protect the Cabbie?<\/p>\n<p>The Strathroy, Ontario, taxi driver in whose cab Aaron Driver was shot and killed would certainly like to know why the police did not act sooner to protect him and to intercept the supposed terrorist before he entered the taxi carrying what RCMP have claimed were two bombs. RCMP officers already had Driver\u2019s home surrounded when Terry Duffield drove his taxi cab into the driveway around 4:30 PM. According to police they swarmed the cab within seconds of Driver entering the back seat. Police claim that with the approach of police Driver detonated one explosive. RCMP claim that it was only in response to that detonation that they shot and killed Driver. In addition to the questions about the nature of a bomb, and its potential to cause mass harm, which could detonate in someone\u2019s lap and not even kill that person directly, there is the question about why police waited, if they really believed Driver carried a serious bomb that posed substantial threat, until he was inside a car with an innocent bystander before approaching him. Why would they give him a chance to detonate the supposed bomb or bombs at all?<\/p>\n<p>For his part Terry Duffield is furious with how police acted, risking his life if their account is true, and is promising legal action against the force. Duffield claims he is still dealing with the shock of that morning\u2019s events and is taking medications for the resulting back pain and stress. In his words: \u201cThere will be legal action taken on this. They put my life in jeopardy\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2016). Duffield, like many observers, is perplexed, to say the least, that police, if they really believed they were dealing with a terrorist carrying explosives and out to launch an \u201cimminent attack,\u201d would not stop the suspect before he put a bystander\u2019s (the public\u2019s) life in danger.<\/p>\n<p>In Duffield\u2019s view, police could have and should have done more to protect him than they did. In his words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don&#8217;t think police handled it very well at all. They did absolutely nothing to help me. At no time did they try to warn me. At no time did they try to stop my vehicle from entering the address\u2026This gentleman was allowed to walk in front of my car, down the side of my car, get in my car and all of these sharp-shooters, all these SWAT teams and all these people who were supposed to be around, nobody did anything until after the bomb went off.\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2016)<\/p>\n<p>This raises real, significant, questions. It makes the critic wonder if police had reason to believe that Driver\u2019s bomb was a phony, incapable of exploding, much like the one that RCMP helped to build for John Nuttall and Amada Korody in their infamous entrapment case of two poor, marginalized, people dealing with addition and mental health issues in Surrey, British Columbia three years before the river case. Perhaps police believed the bomb was no bomb at all (because they had assisted in or directed its\u2019 making). Perhaps the cabbie was part of the public anti-terror takedown gone wrong (there is no evidence of this at this point and Duffield would seem sincere in his claims). In initial reports it was said that Duffield jumped from the taxi before the bomb was detonated. More recent reports (CBC News 2016) say that police ordered him to leave the car after the bomb had already been detonated.<\/p>\n<p>Duffield had a follow up interview with police and specifically asked why the force did not offer him any protection in their operation that morning. The cabbie remains dissatisfied that police offered him no explanation. The public seeks one as well. Duffield, who has retained a lawyer and intends to pursue legal action, and curious observers alike, are left to ponder.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Maintaining Secrecy and Unaccountability in Anti-Terror Cases: No Independent Investigation<\/p>\n<p>Confounding all of this is the fact that there has been, and there will be, no independent public investigation into the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver and any or all of the questionable circumstances surrounding it. Provincial police have been tasked with the investigation into Driver&#8217;s shooting at the request of the Strathroy-Caradoc Police Service (Rieti 2016). The OPP and Strathroy-Caradoc police \u201ccontinue to jointly investigate the incident\u201d under direction of the head of the OPP\u2019s criminal investigations branch. That is, the police, and only the police, are \u201cinvestigating\u201d the police in this case. That has been a consistent recipe for cover up, hush up, distortion, and distraction. And legitimation.<\/p>\n<p>All of this is in keeping with the secrecy, lack of transparency, obfuscation, and disassembly that have been the hallmarks of anti-terror practices in Canada. This includes the secretive actions of the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the Communications Security Establishment Canada (Canada\u2019s NSA) as well as notorious instruments like security certificates which violate all notions of due process and allow for the state to detain people for indefinite periods while subjecting then to \u201ctrials\u201d without disclosure or even a reading of charges against them, ad without proper representation or defense.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Bell, Stewart. 2016a. \u201cISIL Supporter Aaron Driver Was Killed by Police Gunfire, Not Explosive Device He Detonated, Family Says.\u201d <em>The National Post<\/em>.

a small town detachment the Terrace, BC, RCMP have gained some infamy for violence against civilians, including civilian deaths. On August 21, 2016 Nicolas Allan Jeppesen (29) died after being tased by officers of the Terrace RCMP outside the town\u2019s Mills Memorial Hospital. The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the body that reviews police violence involving civilians, is investigating the RCMP involvement in Jeppesen\u2019s death but few details have been provided to the public. The BC Coroner\u2019s Service, which has a broader mandate for investigation, is also investigating.<\/p>\n<p>What has been reported is that in the early afternoon of August 21, RCMP officers were called to the hospital following a report of a man carrying an axe and a possibility that he might do harm to himself. There has been no report that he posed a threat to anyone else. The man was reportedly seen near the area of the hospital\u2019s mental health ward. Upon encountering Jeppesen RCMP used a Taser, a conducted energy weapon, to subdue the man. During the intervention by police the victim received undisclosed injuries, through undisclosed means, from which he died after being taken inside the hospital.<\/p>\n<p>Josh Paterson of the BC Civil Liberties Association notes the concerns around fatalities associated with the use of Tasers by police. In his words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn general we\u2019ve had lots of concerns about the use of conducted energy weapons, the reliability of conductive energy weapons, the safety of them. We understand that it\u2019s a good thing for police to be turning to less lethal force options \u2026 but we\u2019ve seen numerous incidents around North America that Tasers don\u2019t end up always being non-lethal force.\u201d (quoted in Nichols 2016)<\/p>\n<p>There have so far been no independent reports offering information beyond what the RCMP have claimed. Yet there are almost certainly witnesses to the interaction. It is also possible that witnesses will not come forward given the reputation of Terrace RCMP and community fears that exist regarding the force.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Nichols, Trevor. 2016. \u201cMan Dies after B.C.

State Protects the State: Evidence of Wrongdoing but No Charges for Police who Killed Anthony Heffernan","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/08\/24\/the-state-protects-the-state-evidence-of-wrongdoing-but-no-charges-for-police-who-killed-anthony-heffernan\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-4o","content":"<p>In the Canadian state context it is exceedingly rare for police who kill civilians to be charged with a criminal offence, no matter how egregious or obviously criminal their actions are. Often times so-called oversight agencies will exonerate the officers (sometimes because they do not receive full or proper disclosure from obstructionist forces or police associations, as the Ontario Ombudsperson has reported). In other cases the Crown will operate to shield officers who kill by refusing to bring charges even where the oversight agency has found evidence of wrongdoing by police. By refusing to bring charges the Crown acts to protect killer police officers from having to defend their actions in court and foreclosing even the possibility of conviction. The decision to withhold charges also deprives the public, and family members of the victim, from learning the identity of the officers responsible as the bringing of charges is often the only mechanism by which the identities of killer police officers are revealed publicly. Given the close associations and mutual professional benefits of positive relations between police and prosecutors (and the more straightforward interest of the state in defending its own operators) the choice of prosecutors not to charge police even in cases of apparent wrongdoing is not overly surprising.<\/p>\n<p>Yet it is still disappointing particularly for friends and family members of victims and for community advocates. Another such disappointing case of prosecutorial shielding of police came out of Alberta on August 22, 2016 when the Crown prosecutor chose not to bring charges against the officers who killed Anthony Heffernan (27) in 2015, despite the fact that the provincial oversight body, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), found evidence of police wrongdoing through their investigation. Incredibly, the officer who killed Anthony Heffernan has since gone on to kill another man, Dave McQueen, a man in a wheelchair, in 2016. Tellingly the killing of Anthony Heffernan was the closest any police officer has come to being criminally charged for killing someone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Comply or Die Policing Again: The Killing of Anthony Heffernan<\/p>\n<p>Anthony Heffernan was a young man experiencing addiction and mental health issues who was shot multiple times and killed by police despite the fact that he was confined to a room in a Super 8 motel and posed no immediate danger to anyone but perhaps himself. Heffernan suffered three shots to the neck and head. The ASIRT report found that police could Heffernan through the partially opened hotel room door and they described him as \u201cflushed, non-responsive and hyperventilating\u201d (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016). Police described the victim as being \u201cin medical distress\u201d (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016) but there is no proper explanation as to why the response of officers was to shoot someone in distress, and confined to an enclosed space, multiple times. Heffernan was only holding a \u201csmall diabetic needle\u201d with no point on it and a lighter. The entire incident lasted only 72 seconds. In that short amount of time police encountered, engaged, and killed a young man in distress and confined to a room.<\/p>\n<p>This appears to be yet another case of \u201ccomply or die\u201d policing in which someone is killed simply because they do not fulfill the authoritarian wishes of officers shouting commands. Indeed, in this case officers asserted that they shot Heffernan because he did not comply with their orders to drop the needle and lighter. A steep price to pay, summary execution, for failing to satisfy the authoritarian desires of police.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>State Protecting State<\/p>\n<p>The ASIRT report said that although \u201cthere is evidence capable of providing reasonable grounds to believe that an offence or offences have been committed, the Crown opinion has determined that the case does not meet the standard for prosecution\u201d (quoted in Grant and Bell 2016). The family finds this twist of logic to be \u201cshocking.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To excuse their decision not to bring charges the Crown prosecutors, perhaps trying to defuse criticism of their controversial choice released a lengthy statement. It read in part:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe evidence would be that he did so as a defensive action against an individual who was armed with a syringe, and who had been either unwilling or unable to comply with police directions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn all of these circumstances, it could not be disproven that the subject officer acted upon a reasonable belief that he and the other officers were at risk of serious or grievous bodily harm, and that his use of force was necessary.\u201d (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Calgary Chief of Police Roger Chaffin responded by saying he stands by his officer despite noting that he has been reassigned while working \u201cthrough his own, particular issues\u201d (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016). Notably the Chief of Police in Calgary has been so concerned with improper behavior in the force that he has gone on a public witch hunt against whistleblowers in the department who have spoken out against misconduct or named officers involved.<\/p>\n<p>The lawyer for the Heffernan family, Tom Engel, notes that the officer involved in the shooting exercised his right to remain silent during the ASIRT investigation and refused even to give the police oversight agency his notes. This is an incredible privilege given police but denied civilians. It is one reason among many that so-called independent oversight agencies have been so ineffectual (or effective in shielding police) in every provincial context within the Canadian state. Notably, again, not bringing charges protects the officers from having to testify and hand over their notes so the Crown, even in this way, is protecting the officers from necessary public scrutiny regardless of a conviction or not.<\/p>\n<p>The family is planning a civil suit against the police. This is often the last resort option to which families must turn simply to learn the names of officers involved in killing their loved one. In this case the family is hoping that the civil suit against Calgary Police Services and the officers who were in the Super 8 motel room will have to testify and turn over the notes. According to Tom Engel: \u201cIt just seemed that, with all those police officers in the room with all that fire power &#8230; [Anthony] was shot having nothing but a lighter in his hand and possibly approaching the officers, it\u2019s a stretch to say it was a justifiable homicide\u201d (quoted in Grant and Bell 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Engel also points out the double standard that exists because officers are allowed to stay silent and keep their notes under the Police Act. Indeed officers are rarely if ever arrested when they kill someone, even under dubious circumstances. In Engel\u2019s view:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf the tables were reversed and Anthony Heffernan had killed a police officer, they would have arrested him on the spot and had him in for an intensive interrogation trying to break down his will to remain silent. But that\u2019s not the case with a police officer, they don\u2019t arrest him, they carry on an investigation for months or even years.\u201d (quoted in Grant and Bell 2016)<\/p>\n<p>In the case of a civil suit or fatality inquiry the officers would be compelled to testify and would have to turn over the notes. The officers were the only witnesses to the killing and their stories about what happened actually differed in key areas such as the movements of Heffernan before he was shot.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Anyone in Contact with Police is at Tremendous Risk: the Family Responds<\/p>\n<p>The family was devastated by the Crown decision. Given the circumstances around the killing of Anthony Heffernan they expected the bringing of a rare charge of murder against the officer responsible (who would kill again earlier this year). Anthony Heffernan&#8217;s mother, Irene, had hoped \u201cclear and just thinking would prevail, but it didn\u2019t\u201d (quoted in 2016). Heffernan\u2019s father Pat says his son\u2019s killing shows that people are at risk any time they come into contact with police. In his words: \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for all Albertans and Canadians alike. There is no justice in this case. Anthony is dead, and anyone else who comes into contact with police is at tremendous risk &#8230; because they [officers] are going to be supporting each other in whatever needs to be said\u201d (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016).<\/p>\n<p>This is another case that begs us to ask deeper questions about why police are called in the first place. It raises the effects of social isolation and moral panics, around drug use or mental health, which lead people to call police for behavior that is not harming anyone but may be unusual or disturbing. This is a matter manufactured fear and dependence on authorities. And it ends with someone dead at the hands of police upset that their orders have not been obeyed and trained to shoot first, second, and always. And knowing they will not be held accountable for the great harm they do, for the lives they destroy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Grant, Meghan and David Bell. 2016. \u201cAnthony Heffernan\u2019s Family to Sue after Calgary Police Officer Cleared in Fatal Shooting. <em>CBC News<\/em>.

shooting and killing of Aaron Driver (24) by RCMP in Strathroy, Ontario on August 10, 2016 has, as expected, served as a launching point for a variety of government trial balloons on increasing and expanding repressive state policies and practices under the panic conditions of publicly stoked fear over domestic terrorism within Canada. Some of the early proposals from the government may suggest to the concerned observer the manifestation of a sequence on re-education or de-programing from <em>A Clockwork Orange<\/em>. In any event it is clear that the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver has served the function (perhaps intentional from the point of view of the state) of providing the necessary cover to bring forward a new regimen of repressive anti-terror governance and social regulation. Even as more questions are being raised by the circumstances of someone being killed for planning a terror attack despite the fact that the bomb he supposedly detonated on his lap was not strong enough to kill even himself (as this week\u2019s coroner\u2019s report showed Driver was killed by a police bullet as he was shot twice by police) (Ballingall 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fear Politics and New Regimes of Repression in Canada<\/p>\n<p>The police operation that ended in the killing of Driver was carried out within a specific context of growing calls for review, revision, or repeal of the Canadian government\u2019s controversial and widely opposed Anti-Terrorism Act (better known as C-51). The timing of the Driver killing, in a period of public review and criticism of anti-terror legislation is not unique. Indeed previous recent cases, such as the police shooting of supposed \u201clone wolf\u201d Michael Zehaf-Bibeau at Parliament Hill in 2014 and the announcement of the arrests of John Nuttall and Amanda Korody in 2013 (in a case since ruled in court to be entirely police entrapment), occurred within a context of discussion over the Canadian state\u2019s anti-terrorism regime and policies.<\/p>\n<p>Jeff Shantz and Hisham Ramadan (2016) have outlined the political mechanisms by which fear is converted to repressive policy, particularly within the context of even events associated, even falsely, with (imagined) terrorism. Their discussions detail and explain the manipulation of state involved \u201cterror plots\u201d and the public discussion of responses (by police, courts, government) to them in dramatizing the need for more repressive regimes to address supposed \u201chome grown terrorism.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Only a week after the RCMP shot Aaron Driver, a young man already processed through the courts and released on an anti-terror peace bond restricting his movements and access to cell phones and the internet, and the federal Liberal government is already, again as expected, making noises about new repressive policies which would allow for increased surveillance as well as intrusive measures to control people\u2019s \u201cbad thoughts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a presentation to the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in Ottawa, on August 17, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale revealed that the federal government is looking to make so-called counter-radicalization counselling mandatory for anyone under an anti-terrorism peace bonds. Notably, this provision has been part of C-51 but was struck down by a Winnipeg judge in the case involving Aaron Driver.<\/p>\n<p>Goodale has insisted that a federal consultation on national security must be undertaken and he expects it to conclude by the end of 2016. Notably, Goodale has positioned this consultation as a means to innovate new repressive and intrusive measures rather than as a mechanism of ratcheting down anti-terror policies and procedures (such as ending security certificates which have been used to hold racialized, migrants under vague government claims of some association with terrorism, under conditions that violate due process or by abolishing the anti-terror list which is used to criminalize resistance movements that oppose ally states of the Canadian government).<\/p>\n<p>Tellingly the Liberal government is using the police killing of Aaron Driver to openly promote the idea of counter-radicalization, which, in fact, they had raised before the Driver shooting and which had, at that time, raised obvious red flags for critics.\u00a0 The federal government actually views the establishment of a federal office of counter-radicalization as a centerpiece of their anti-terror regime. The office of counter-radicalization would serve as \u201ca national focal point for research, counselling and intervention services\u201d (Bronskill 2016a). Goodale, in speaking to the chiefs of police re-stated the government\u2019s prioritization of this center for controlling \u201cbad thoughts\u201d and re-education. And despite Goodale\u2019s simultaneous claim that consultation and reflection are key to the government approach going forward he unapologetically presents this initiative as one that must happen without public consulation or review before the end of this summer. According to Goodale: \u201cWe are in the process of recruiting the person that will lead the effort. And we are determined to get this office up and running toward the end of the summer, the beginning of the fall. The incident is Strathroy demonstrates how very important this priority is\u201d (quoted in Bronskill 2016a). Note that the police killing of Aaron Driver is openly asserted as the impetus for rushing the \u201cbad thoughts\u201d center into existence. Interestingly Goodale acknowledged that there had been efforts to de-radicalized or counsel Driver but they had not been systematic.<\/p>\n<p>Goodale again referenced the Aaron Driver case, and what he supposedly represents, in justifying the de-radicalization, re-education center. According to Goodale, the government views as among its greatest security concerns the so-called \u201clone wolves\u201d who are drawn to \u201cextreme ideologies (Bronskill 2016a). In his words: \u201cWe need to understand what positive messages can counteract the insidious poison that draws people in, especially young people (quoted in Bronskill 2016a). No word from Goodale what the positive messages involve but one might guess from Liberal government practice they should include the benefits of war in Iraq and Syria and the selling of arms to the brutal terror regime in Saudi Arabia.<\/p>\n<p>Minister Goodale has also raised the prospect of putting people released on peace bonds under constant surveillance. He noted that Driver was not under constant surveillance, something the RCMP bemoan. According to Goodale:\u00a0 \u201cThat is obviously a lesson that one needs to look at very carefully, as a result of the incident in Strathroy. And we are examining very carefully what we need to do to make our police and security activity more effective\u201d (quoted in Bronskill 2016a). Again, we should remember that peace bonds can be and are placed on people under virtually no evidence at a threshold much lower than would ever lead to successful prosecution. So the real result of the government proposal would be to allow constant surveillance of people who show no or minimal signs of actually engaging in a terrorist act. Such would have been contentious to say the least before the killing of Aaron Driver. It is now a supposed necessity, a lesson learned from that case. Goodale refused to comment on whether surveillance has in fact been stepped up for the dozen or so people who are currently under anti-terrorism peace bonds (Bronskill 2016a).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Turn Over Your Password: Invasive Policing and the Terror Panic<\/p>\n<p>Minister Goodale was not prepared to stop there however and has raised the prospect of giving police what they want in terms of invasive policing. In his meeting with the chiefs of police Goodale also gave notice that Canadians \u201cneed to think about how far police should be allowed to go in accessing their electronic devices and communications\u201d (Bronskill, 2016b). Indeed, following the Driver killing, the government is going to use the occasion of a federal review of cybersecurity to discuss a proposal prepared by the country\u2019s police chiefs for a new law that would compel people to reveal their passwords with the court\u2019s consent (Bronskill 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>At his meeting with police chiefs, Goodale \u201cacknowledged that smartphones contain a wealth of personal data and can reveal much more about a person than an ordinary physical search might\u201d (Bronskill 2016b). While conceding that people do value their privacy, Goodale also suggested that people would be willing to compromise that concern in order to give police more tools, particularly to pursue terror related activities. According to Goodale: \u201cI think Canadians recognize the imperatives on both sides\u201d (quoted in Bronskill 2016b). Yet this is not a matter of weighing equivalences. Either police have access to deeply personal private information or they do not. And one must always ask under what circumstances they gain access. Again, connecting this access to a peace bond would be connecting it to potentially nothing in terms of real evidence or legitimate concern. Civil liberties groups and privacy critics have suggested that such legislation would be unconstitutional (something that has certainly never deterred police chiefs or their supporters in government).<\/p>\n<p>While the public has shown no desire for such legislation or interest in debating it, Goodale is using the Driver case to suggest that debate on this policy is now needed. According to Goodale:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a critically important subject area, and one that \u2014 for one reason or another \u2014 has not been subject to adequate public discussion. I think over the course of the fall, it will. And that will help us as a government and it will also help police forces and security agencies to define the parameters.\u201d (quoted in Bronskill 2016b)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Never mind that there has been much public opposition to similar proposals from the former ruling Conservative government. He RCMP killing of Aaron Driver has changed the terrain of operations for the Liberal government. How fortuitous indeed.<\/p>\n<p>Minister Goodale also used the occasion to raise the panic figure of the lone wolf in a basement. In his words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe hackers and scammers who are constantly trying to break into our information systems are a motley but potent combination of foreign states, militaries, terror groups, organized crime, petty thieves and vandals, and even that lonely computer geek in his underwear in the basement.\u201d (quoted in Bronskill 2016b)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Goodale also noted that this is also a real opportunity for investment or profit for small and large firms alike. Again this is a further convergence in the anti-terror trajectory of neoliberal accumulation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>All of these utterances, musings, and proposals for repressive and invasive state policies and practices have been presented within the space of only a single week following the police killing of Aaron Driver. For those of us observing and commenting on government anti-terror regimes, fear politics, and state regulatory frameworks more broadly such moves by the government after the Driver killing were, far from being surprising, actually expected at least generally if not in these specifics (see Shantz 2016).<\/p>\n<p>In this the police killing of Aaron Driver, within the context of an as yet unconfirmed attempt at terrorism, stands with other cases such as the Germinal collective set up in 2001, the Zehaf-Bibeau killing, and the Nuttall and Korody entrapment. We should expect that further, more extensive, invasive, and punitive policies and practices will emerge and be brought forward under the guise of public consultation (framed and shadowed by the Aaron Driver case). Such is the position of the killing of Aaron Driver within the manufacture of social phobias and fear in the current social and political context within the Canadian state (a state that is, remember, active in war).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Ballingall, Alex. 2016. \u201cTerrorist Suspect Killed by RCMP Bullet, Family Says.\u201d <em>Toronto Star<\/em>.

Canada","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/08\/13\/deceptive-and-repressive-force-the-aaron-driver-killing-police-distortions-and-anti-terror-cases-in-canada\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-4h","content":"<p>Serious questions need to be asked in the wake of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) killing of supposed terror suspect Aaron Driver (24), shot by RCMP officers on August 10 following an apparent tip from the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). RCMP claim Driver detonated an explosive device in a cab and that he was killed because he had access to another device. \u00a0Among the questions that require answers are how someone who was on a terror peace bond which restricted his actions and access to the internet could compile information and materials to build a bomb and build it under such conditions. It must also be answered why someone under watch by RCMP as a terror suspect was able to leave his house with two supposed bombs with no intervention beforehand (and after the supposed tip was received).<\/p>\n<p>These questions, and questions about RCMP anti-terror operations more broadly, are particularly pressing given that the killing of Driver comes within a month of a major court decision finding that the RCMP had entrapped two poor people, dealing with mental health and addiction issues, in a phony police created and directed \u201cterror threat.\u201d In that case the RCMP spent millions of dollars in labor and resource to target and prime two poor residents of Surrey, B.C., John Nutall and Amanda Korody, lavishing gifts and attention on them in an attempt to get them to go along with a fake terror plot instigated and planned by the RCMP. The court decision confirmed that the threat came only from the RCMP, who conceived it and provided all of the means to carry it out (the supposed bomb had no detonator), and who manipulated the reluctant and confused couple to go along, even as they offered resistance, for fear of losing the newfound benefits being provided by the RCMP (in meals, companionship, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>Given this context the real, and fundamental, question is why anyone should trust and accept the RCMP version of events. This case has the markings of distortion and deception that mark other so-called anti-terror investigations in the Canadian state context from the Germinal Collective case (even before 9\/11) to \u201cProject Thread,\u201d through the \u201cToronto 18,\u201d to the entrapment of John Nuttall and Amanda Korody. In the Germinal Collective, \u201cToronto 18\u201d and Nuttall and Korody cases in particular, the police were actively, centrally, involved in the instigating, planning, encouraging, and operationalizing of terror acts that were never carried out (and never would have been in the absence of police). As Shantz (2016) writes, these cases are primarily designed and carried out to give the police justification for continued or expanded resources and to stoke social fear, social phobias (particularly Islamophobia, fear of migrants, and fear of poor people).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Killing of Aaron Driver<\/p>\n<p>The killing of Aron Driver by RCMP officers apparently began with a tip from the FBI that a person in Canada was possibly planning to carry out a terrorist attack. There have also been reports that the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), which operates the city\u2019s subway, buses, and trolley cars, received a threat against the transit system. In response to the FBI tip, details of which are not known, the RCMP descended upon the home of Aaron Driver, a young man who had been arrested and released on an anti-terror peace bond for attempting to justify the actions of ISIS as acts of self-defense in a time of war. Driver had not been observed or charged for engaging in any activities related to terrorism. He had been targeted solely for his ideas and social media presence.<\/p>\n<p>On the surface the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver, if one is to believe events as the police describe them, is fairly straightforward. On Wednesday, August 10, 2016, the federal RCMP converged on the house in which Aaron Driver was living in the community of Strathroy, a small city of around 20,000 people in southwestern Ontario. Sometime after 4:00 PM police observed Driver leave his residence and enter a taxi waiting in his driveway. Police report that shortly thereafter, as police approached the vehicle, Driver detonated an explosive device injuring himself and causing minor injuries to the taxi operator. The police also claim seeing a second device and responding by shooting Driver, killing him.<\/p>\n<p>So far all of the details provided have come only from the RCMP who have been the only ones to claim to be witnesses to these events. Yet why should we believe the RCMP account? And what sorts of questions need to be asked about it? A closer look at the Driver case leaves many questions hanging in the air.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Punishing Bad Thoughts: The Aaron Driver Case<\/p>\n<p>Of note, Driver had been initially targeted for punishment by police not for any suspected actions but simply for attempting to justify the actions of ISIS in online venues. That is, the police targeting of Aaron Driver was an early effort by the state to criminalize people simply for expressing \u201cbad thoughts\u201d\u2014a repressive policy approach, in violation of civil and human rights, which Conservative and Liberal governments alike have pursued and sought to expand in the Canadian context (on the policing of bad thoughts see Shantz 2014).<\/p>\n<p>Aaron Driver had come to the attention of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) in October of 2014 when he was reported to be tweeting support for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria under the online name of Harun Abdurahman. Driver had also justified the 2014 attack on a ceremonial officer at Ottawa\u2019s War Memorial and run to Parliament Hill (seat of federal government) by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, as a military response to Canadian military actions in Iraq and Syria. For this Driver was arrested and brought before the court in Winnipeg.<\/p>\n<p>Driver was released on an anti-terror peace bond. Under its terms he was not allowed to associate with any terrorist organization and was under prohibitions against using a computer or cellphone. Driver was also required to live at a specified address in Strathroy, Ontario and to notify a specified RCMP sergeant should there be any changes in his address (Canadian Press 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The peace bond allows for intermediate constraints on a person\u2019s liberty on the basis of evidence that would not be sufficient to prove an actual terrorism offence (Forcese 2016). As one can see there are real spaces for abuse and unjust application with such an instrument. Indeed the court is unlikely to turn down any request by the federal government to apply an anti-terror peace bond.<\/p>\n<p>And recall that John Nuttall and Amanda Korody, who had spent three years incarcerated under what was nothing other than an RCMP entrapment scheme, were re-arrested mere hours after being released following the finding of entrapment. That was clearly a punitive (and mean-spirited) attempt by the government, and RCMP, to save some face or recoup some losses.<\/p>\n<p>After Driver&#8217;s killing his former lawyer, Leonard Tailleur, stated publicly that there was no evidence that the young man was in any way directly affiliated with ISIS or with any other supposed terrorist organization (Canadian Press 2016). He found the claims of police against Driver to not fit with the man\u2019s character as he knew him. According to Tailleur: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking. Absolutely shocking, actually. He was generally looked to be low risk as long as there&#8217;s certain things that had been dealt with\u201d (quoted in Canadian Press 2016)<\/p>\n<p>Tailleur suggested that the killing of Aaron Driver raises some significant questions. He notes that Driver was almost certainly under regular police surveillance (Canadian Press 2016). In Tailleur\u2019s words: \u201cIf he was doing his thing, it was kind of ridiculous because I&#8217;m certain he was going to be under scrutiny beyond his peace bond. Police would always monitor his whereabouts &#8230; They&#8217;d make him a priority\u201d (quoted in Canadian Press 2016). So how could he compile materials and instructions to construct two bombs? How could he leave his house with the two bombs in hand? Why was he not stopped before entering a cab and putting a cabbie at risk?<\/p>\n<p>Even from a liberal perspective many questions arise from the killing of Aaron Driver. Legal scholar Craig Forcese outlines some of these:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow did someone known to authorities and subject to a peace bond get as far as posing a credible (and perhaps actual) suicide bomb threat?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhy was the police intervention 11th hour, in the nick of time (and perhaps after it, given that there was a reported explosion causing injury)?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGiven the presence of a weapon and that there was apparently a computer video involved, Driver was in clear violation of his peace bond terms (and so basically automatically subject to imprisonment for up to 4 years). So why was there no arrest much earlier?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhy was there no public warning?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll of this is to say: Where was the early detection? Was this a resource issue? Did something go missing? Will be discussing a failure to \u2018connect the dots\u2019?\u201d (Forcese 2016)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>All of this leads inexorably to the question: \u201cWas the Aaron Driver killing part of yet another entrapment case, like Germinal and like Nuttall and Korody, which somehow went too far or took an unforeseen turn?\u201d Or: \u201cWas it a dangerous game of chicken in which the RCMP miscalculated?\u201d Regardless of one\u2019s view on the matter of this killing by police, it is clear that answers will not be provided by RCMP or CSIS accounts alone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What Comes of It: Fear Politics and Continuing Repression<\/p>\n<p>To properly understand the real impact and consequences of the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver socially we need only look to current debates over anti-terror laws, particularly the controversial and widely unpopular Anti-Terrorism Act (better known as Bill C-51) initiated by the then-ruling Conservative government prior to the 2016 election, and the recent rebuke of RCMP practices in the Nuttall-Korody decision. This includes a call that emerged immediately in response to the Driver killing to review, and stiffen, terror related peace bonds, the same control mechanisms notably that the government seeks to impose on Nuttall and Korody and for which cause they were re-arrested shortly after their release following the entrapment decision. After the Driver killing the calls are to make the peace bonds even more restrictive and punitive.<\/p>\n<p>The Driver killing comes as critics have been calling for the Liberal government to finally follow through on their election promise, prominent during the campaign, to revise C-51. Now the discussions of possible C-51 revisions will be shadowed by the Driver case and its use by security forces and politicians alike to defend the legislation and perhaps even build upon it.<\/p>\n<p>The cynic will certainly note that on two other occasions in which C-51 and anti-terror laws were set to be debated in federal parliament the discussions were inflamed by highly visible so-called acts of terrorism. Perhaps ironically, the most recent one included the shooting of Canadian Forces soldier Nathan Cirillo by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the online justification of which brought river to the attention of the security apparatus in the first place. It might be noted that, in terms of definitions of terrorism, Zehaf-Bibeau only sought military and government targets and did not target or harm civilians even as he had ample opportunity to do so during his adventure in busy downtown Ottawa.<\/p>\n<p>The reactionary Conservative Party of Canada, authors and shepherds of C-51, have already made this connection of the Driver case to the maintenance of intrusive anti-terror laws explicit. In the words of the Conservative Party\u2019s interim leader Rona Ambrose the morning after Driver was killed:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI salute and thank the law enforcement and intelligence officers who put their own lives on the line to stop this potential attack on innocent Canadians. Unfortunately, the Liberal government campaigned on a promise to strip these officers of some of the essential investigative and enforcement tools to do this work, which the previous Conservative government provided through Bill C-51, and which have already been wisely used to disrupt terrorist activities nearly two dozen times since last fall. I call on the Liberal government to ensure all of Canada&#8217;s security and intelligence services keep the tools they need to do their jobs.\u201d (quoted in Wherry 2016)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Numerous concerns were raised by a broad cross section of the public in Canada immediately upon the announcement of Bill C-51. Concerns were raised that provisions in the legislation criminalize acts of civil disobedience, such as a protest or demonstration because these could be viewed as \u201cunlawful\u201d (in the absence of a permit, or in cases of trespassing, or marches in roadways). Other essential activities, such as a workplace strike or occupation or boycott could be viewed as terrorist acts on the basis that they impact economic structures or practices. Worries have also been stated about provisions that allow for the punishing of bad thoughts or propaganda rather than actual activities related to terrorist acts.<\/p>\n<p>During the federal election of 2015 the Liberal Party, then seeking to succeed the Conservatives as ruling party, promised legislation that would address key concerns within C-51. Yet approaching a year later after taking power the Liberals have still not tabled even proposals on how they might transform C-51, leaving some critics to believe that the election promises were simply appeals for votes on the basis of countering widely unpopular legislation (which seemed emblematic of the authoritarian and repressive Conservative Party approach). The Liberal government has said in general terms that any new legislation would: \u201cguarantee that all Canadian Security Intelligence Service warrants respect the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; ensure that Canadians are not limited from lawful protests and advocacy; narrow overly broad definitions, such as defining \u2018terrorist propaganda\u2019 more clearly;\u201d as well as \u201climit Communications Security Establishment&#8217;s powers by requiring a warrant to engage in the surveillance of Canadians\u201d (quoted in Wherry 2016).<\/p>\n<p>At the same time there is nothing to suggest, despite the intimations of the Conservative Party and their leader Rona Ambrose, that C-51 provisions played or could have played any part in a case like that of Aaron Driver. The RCMP supposedly acted on the basis of a tip coming not from their own surveillance or intelligence but rather from the FBI. In addition Driver was already subject to a terror peace bond which have been in operation since before C-51 took effect. Notably Driver\u2019s legal team mounted a successful challenge which resulted in a Manitoba judge ruling against the provision in C-51 that allowed the courts to mandate religious counselling for an individual on a peace bond (Wherry 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Another line of pursuit for repressive forces in the Canadian context involves calling into question the anti-terror peace bond, not on grounds that it threatens civil liberties and is too broad, but on obverse grounds that it is too lenient. On one hand there are calls for imprisonment of people simply on the basis of the low threshold evidence used in securing the peace bond. This would mean criminalizing bad thoughts, which, in fact, many police and politicians desire anyway. As law professor Craig Forcese suggests: \u201cIncarceration depends, however, on a crime. And our terrorism criminal law already sets the tripwire for terrorism crime very far from actual acts of violence. (None of the two dozen or so persons in prison for post-9\/11 terrorism crimes got further than plotting before they were charged and convicted)\u201d (2016). Calls for incarceration on the low level of evidence provided for a peace bond will put many people in prison who pose no material threat to anyone (except perhaps to themselves). It will, however, give an opportunity for expansion of the security, surveillance, and policing apparatus as well as the prison-industrial complex, which is precisely what many police agencies and politicians alike desire.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, some hawks will call for greater integration of security and intelligence services. This will include not only calls for tighter integration or greater communication and information transfer between agencies within the Canadian state (among local police forces, the RCMP, CSIS, perhaps the military). It will also include calls for greater integration and\/or communication between the Canadian agencies and external agencies like the FBI or MI5. This will be highlighted especially given the apparently lead and crucial role played by the FBI in the Driver affair. Indeed even liberal critics like Forcese have been quick to proclaim that coordination between police and CSIS, as in the Driver case \u201cis welcome\u201d (proclaiming even before all the facts are known that \u201cthe system worked\u201d in this case) (see Forcese 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Menacingly the Liberal government has suggested a focus on counter-radicalization strategies. While they have provided not even general notions of what this might entail there are examples from other liberal democracies that open ominous possibilities, including the case in the UK in which legislation requires post-secondary faculty to report to police instances in which students appear to be radicalizing. Notably some have used the Driver example to argue that the so-called religious therapy provision in anti-terror peace bonds, deemed \u201cdeprogramming\u201d by the court and struck down, should have been upheld and should now be imposed in future cases.<\/p>\n<p>Following the Aaron Driver killing the Liberal government is clearly open to additions to the apparatus as part of the C-51 discussions. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, addressing questions after the Driver killing said the government will now \u201cconsult Canadians about what else they want to see in their national security framework\u201d (quoted in Wherry 2016). What else indeed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>In all of this the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver provides another example of the political production of fear for purposes of state, particularly police, expansion. It provides another opportunity for the dramatization of evil by state authorities at various levels. This can in turn be used to shore up or develop new mechanisms of surveillance, criminalization, and punishment. It can be used to reinforce legislation, like C-51, that faces criticism and possible revision. It can provide the impetus for new, more repressive, legislation. It can be used to increase the flow of resources to agencies like the RCMP. In addition such moments of manipulable terror panic can be used to spread policing practices into other sectors. Such is the case in legislation, as in the UK that seeks to turn professors into spies, snitches, or cops.<\/p>\n<p>All of this must be resisted. Police must always be challenged and countered on their exclusive descriptions of events (and monopoly on knowledge about the circumstances of such cases). Police accounts should never be accepted at face value. There must also be public mobilizations against any and all attempts to expand the security state apparatus. Furthermore, public manipulation of terror panics must be called out and attempts by state and media actors to manufacture social phobias confronted.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Canadian Press. 2016. \u201cFBI Tip Led RCMP to Thwart Possible Terrorist Act by Aaron Driver in Strathroy, Ont.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

The everyday reality of police surveillance, harassment, intimidation, confinement, and brutality against Black people, Black communities, gives the lie to Canadian mythologies of tolerance, openness, equality, diversity. It also undermines assumptions of social peace within Canadian liberal democracy, showing the reality of a social war carried out against racialized, as well as poor, migrant, working class communities. Many across Canada are unaware of the violence routinely inflicted on Somali Canadian communities in cities like Ottawa and Toronto, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday, July 24, 2016, Ottawa police beat Abdirahman Abdi, a 37 year-old Somali Canadian man, so severely that he had to be placed on life support. On Monday, July 25, Abdi died of the injuries inflicted by officers.<\/p>\n<p>Abdi was well known and liked among residents in his Hilda Street neighborhood, in Ottawa\u2019s Hintonburg. He was described by neighbors as \u201cpeaceful\u201d and \u201cbeautiful.\u201d A familiar face to many in the area, Abdi was subjected to a vicious beating by police as they arrested him according to numerous witnesses (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was taken to Ottawa Civic Hospital and was on life support for more than 24 hours. According to a family spokesperson the hospital told them Abdi had already been dead for 45 minutes before arriving in the hospital\u2019s care (CBC News 2016).<\/p>\n<p>In a situation rare in the Canadian context, the two Ottawa police officers under investigation for Abdi\u2019s death were identified within a day of his death. Unlike the situation in the United States, the names of officers involved in killings of civilians are rarely released unless there are formal charges laid and rarely are the officers named so soon after a killing. In his case the two officers have been identified as Constable Daniel Montsion and Constable Dave Weir. Weir is a patrol officer but Montsion, is a member of the direct action response team (DART) usually deployed against supposed gang members (Jay 2016). In video posted online Weir is the officer seen kneeling on the bleeding victim\u2019s head.<\/p>\n<p>The police killing of Abdirahman Abdi puts a spotlight on racist state violence in Canada. It makes clear, emphasizes, structures of cultural imperialism, social war, pacification. As numerous cases documented by killercopscanada it shows the everyday, regular, normalized character of police violence particularly as it is deployed against Black and Indigenous communities in the Canadian context (and this includes detention, incarceration, etc., the full extent of the criminal justice system). This is not an aberration or lapse or malfunction. It is the policing system doing as it was designed to do.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that is changing, significantly, is the response to the police extinguishment of Black lives. The response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has shown forcefully the growing community strength and mobilization of collective strength to oppose police violence. The actions of Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman have ensured that this killing will not be treated in the way that so many before it have been. The police, and more importantly the society, cannot \u201csimply move on.\u201d \u00a0This is telling as it openly exposes the reality of police violence as well as organizing and acting to stop it. Even more it raises prospects for alternatives to policing as an institution itself and shows the community resources, connection, care that would be required to build alternatives. The community care, love and compassion, in Abdi\u2019s neighborhood, expressed even in attempts to get the cops to stop their assault provides a striking counter-example to the invasive, angry, repressive, punitive approach of the Ottawa police.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Police Killing of Abdirahman Abdi<\/p>\n<p>Police supposedly were responding to a 911 call from the nearby Bridgehead coffee shop at 9:30 AM. The call apparently suggested a man was causing a disturbance and touching a woman at the caf\u00e9 (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There is no suggestion that Abdi was the person referred to in the call but according to witnesses he became frightened by the arrival of police and fled the coffee shop for his apartment, the building in which the Somali migrant had lived since landing in Ottawa in 2009 ( Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There are terrible histories of police violence against racialized immigrants in the Canadian context. In major cities like Toronto and Ottawa Somali migrants have been subjected to racial profiling, targeted policing, intimidation, and violence.<\/p>\n<p>Several neighbors, including friends and family of the victim, witnessed the brutal police arrest. Shockingly they suggested that Abdi was beaten after being handcuffed and restrained. Zeinab Abdallah, an older Somali woman who lives in the building where the killing took place described the situation in horrific detail. She was leaving the building as Abdi arrived pursued by police. The frightened Abdi called to her in Somali: \u201cSister, protect me from them. Zeinab, help me. Zeinab, help me\u201d (quoted in Jay 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Her terrifying account continues in detail of the awful assault:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs I looked one side, I was shocked, since my looking to that direction coincided with the policeman hitting him with a stick, the very moment he held the door trying to get inside. He was fleeing the policeman and was trying to go inside the building. Having received the blow, he turned back and grabbed the policeman, they grabbed each other, two strong men, the policeman tackled him and threw him to the ground, hitting him repeatedly. And there was this cut here and his blood run on the ground. Then he started beating him hard with the object he was carrying, and when he did so, I pleaded with him to stop the assault, informing him that the man was mentally ill.\u201d (quoted in Jay 2016)<\/p>\n<p>In the view of Abdallah the police wanted their victim dead. Nothing less. They would not listen to her pleas that they stop. As she explains:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI pleaded with him, \u2018Please don\u2019t beat him, please, he can\u2019t listen, he don\u2019t care.\u2019 The other policeman joined him, they did whatever they wanted with him until he became incapacitated. I have never seen anything similar to the way they beat him with such malice, animosity and hostility. They simply didn\u2019t want him alive, they wanted him dead.\u201d (quoted in Jay 2016)<\/p>\n<p>Another witness Ross McGhie described an officer in a DART vest (now identified as Montsion) delivering a number of very heavy blows to the victim\u2019s head and face (Jay 2016). Witnesses suggest the DART officer, the second officer arriving, began hitting Abdi immediately upon his arrival on the scene.<\/p>\n<p>One witness, Shukri Samater, reported that people were calling out to inform officers about Abdi\u2019s health issues and language barriers as he was being handcuffed and struck by officers on the stone steps right outside the entrance to the building (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Samater: \u201cThat was the most disturbing part of it all, what happened after he was handcuffed. \u201cHe was bleeding from the back of his head. He didn\u2019t have a weapon, he wasn\u2019t violent\u201d (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Samater reported seeing officers kneeling on the back of Abdi\u2019s head. She said police deployed a substance she believed to be pepper spray before hitting the helpless man with a baton (Jackson 2016). According to Samater police told bystanders not to call paramedics for assistance (Lofaro 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Abdi&#8217;s brother Abdirizaq Abdi described the scene of the assault by police after being alerted by a neighbor. In his words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI heard the screaming, and then I come out and I see my brother lying down, police hitting so badly. Like, I\u2019ve never seen something like that in my life. All of them, they were on top of him. He was under [them] &#8230; they were hitting like [he was] an enemy. I\u2019ve never seen something like that.\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2016)<\/p>\n<p>According to family friend Nimao Ali who recorded the aftermath of the assault: \u201cIt was devastating to see that he was bleeding, and as I looked at him he actually stopped moving. So I could see he stopped breathing. And it took a long time for the ambulance to come, and it&#8217;s really sad to see that\u201d (quoted in Nease 2016a). The video she took shows the violence of the scene.<\/p>\n<p>The words used to describe Abdirahman Abdi by neighbors are \u201cpleasant,\u201d \u201cgentle,\u201d and \u201cnon-violent.\u201d Neighbors note that Abdi struggled with mental health issues and noted that language barriers may have kept him from understanding what police were saying to him. Residents alerted police to Abdi\u2019s mental health issues and told them of the language barrier in an attempt to stop the assault, to no avail. According to Samater: \u201cThe community knows he\u2019s not well. We try to protect him\u201d (quoted in Jackson 2016). They maintained those efforts to look out for their neighbor in the face of unfolding police brutalization.<\/p>\n<p>Family friend Nimao Ali described Abdi as a \u201cbeautiful soul\u201d (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Ali: \u201cHe is a beautiful person. He was not 100 per cent healthy like us, he had a mental illness. He was the kind of man that when you walk into the elevator he will hold the door for you, always had a smile on his face\u201d (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Ali questioned the quick resort to brutal force by police. In her clearly stated perspective:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c[T]here\u2019s times people have to use their common sense, and there\u2019s times people have to be sensitive to other people, and there\u2019s times that police officers \u2014 or anybody with guns and weapons \u2014 have to really consider: Is this person OK? Are they mentally ill? Are they running away? Are they threatening me? All the blood that he lost could have been saved for a matter of just really taking this calmly. Because everybody in the [neighbourhood knows him] and we never felt threatened by him.\u201d (quoted in CBC News 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The aftermath of the police assault was recorded by an upstairs neighbor and a 27 minute video posted online. It shows a bleeding Abdi handcuffed and laying on the ground. Another neighbor claims to have taken a video but has not yet released it in respect to the family (Ritchie and Jackson 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Leslie Emory, executive director of OCISO immigrant support services, of which Abdi was a client, recalls: \u00a0\u201cHe is very much a very present figure on the street. He walked a lot\u201d (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was known in his own neighborhood. And people cared for him. He was regularly encountered, a neighborhood presence. Now gone.<\/p>\n<p>Nimao Ali stated the horror felt by many neighbors. In her words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s devastating. We know him, the gentleman. He has a mental illness, a very peaceful guy. I have children in the building and he walks around, he\u2019s good with the kids, he\u2019s good with all the neighbours, never a problem. And all of a sudden, that he\u2019s bleeding on the front steps of our building and dying, it was a devastating thing to see.\u201d (quoted in Nease 2016a).<\/p>\n<p>The victim of police violence was clearly someone who was recognized, valued, appreciated in the neighborhood. And none of this community knowledge was held by police who are typically an outside, occupying and invading, force that has little understanding of or care for specific neighborhoods and their experiences, needs, or interests. Police rarely seek to know any of this.<\/p>\n<p>Residents of this Ottawa neighborhood also know first-hand and intimately about the convergence of police violence, brutality, lethal force, and racism. Ali was strong in stating that it was the first thing that came to mind in this case. And sadly it is a lesson taught to children at an early age. As a matter of survival. As she reflects:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had my six-year-old when I was recording and it broke my heart. I had to cover his eyes with one hand while I recorded, and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018OK, what\u2019s going to happen to him when he grows up?\u2019 So it is a fear and it is something that needs to be addressed and it\u2019s something we need to speak out about.\u201d (quoted in Nease 2016a)<\/p>\n<p>This is the reality for racialized people and communities in the Canadian state context. It is a reality the police, politicians, media, dominant cultural expressions seek to cover up, ignore, or deny. It is the reality that Black Lives Matter has so courageously, honestly, consistently brought into focus as the truth of Canadian social life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Black Lives Matter<\/p>\n<p>Black Lives Matter supporter Hana Jama, as well a Somali Canadian with first-hand understanding of police treatment of the community, acknowledged the lack of complete details made public regarding the assault but rightly noted that \u201cat the same time, we do know that the man who was beaten up by police was a black man, was a Muslim man, was a Somali man and was a mentally ill man\u201d (quoted in CTV News 2016). These facts alone raise serious questions, in addition to concerns about the specific brutality exercised by police. According to Jama: \u201cThat should be enough to know that happened to him was messed up\u201d (quoted in CTV News 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Another community advocate Alicia LeJour, of the organization No Justice No Peace, questioned the attempt by police and some media to use passive terminology to present what was an active act of violence, an attack, by police. In her view it was \u201cclear that this man was in good condition until he came into contact with police and he was suddenly bleeding and on the ground. I\u2019m not too sure how they classify that as a medical emergency as opposed to police brutality\u201d (quoted in CTV News 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Not only community activists but lawyers have raised concerns about the police actions against Abdi. According to criminal defense lawyer Leo Russomanno this case looks to be another example, in a growing line, of police \u201cresorting to excessive use of force\u201d and \u201cperhaps our frontline officers being inadequately able to deal with people with mental health issues\u201d (quoted in CTV News 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Similarly Ottawa lawyer Michael Spratt, who has experience in cases involving excessive police force (but is not directly involved with the current case) has expressed concern over what he has heard in early reports regarding this arrest. According to Spratt:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are often times injuries incurred trying to arrest someone in a dynamic situation, but the reports of gratuitous violence after handcuffs were placed on the individual [are] shocking and there can be no excuse for violence after the person is handcuffed and on the ground. The lack of immediate medical attention and the reports about the delays between when first aid was administered and when paramedics arrived is troubling as well. When a subject is detained and handcuffed and has been beaten into unconsciousness, there can be no reasonable reason why medical attention should be delayed.\u201d (quoted in CTV News 2016)<\/p>\n<p>On Tuesday, July 26, dozens of people attended Hintonburg&#8217;s Somerset Square to remember Abdi and celebrate his life (Aylward 2016). Messages were written in chalk on the pavement at the square proclaiming \u201cBlack Live Matter\u201d and \u201c#JusticeForAbdirahman.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Community members expressed great anger at what they recognize to be an injustice carried out at the hands of police in their community (Aylward 2016). In the words of attendee Grace Main: \u201cFor me, this is a turning point in my trust in the police services. I have to change a lot of things about my understanding about what\u2019s safe in my neighbourhood and this part of the world right now\u201d (quoted in Aylward 2016).<\/p>\n<p>This reflects an apparently growing shift in consciousness regarding police in the Canadian context a shift that is gaining public expression largely through the efforts of Black Lives Matter organizing. While police violence and lethal brutality are too often downplayed in Canada, or given less attention and sustained response than cases in the United States, racialized communities which are disproportionately subjected to police targeting, are mobilizing effectively to raise awareness and challenge police actions in effective, material ways.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Investigating a Killer Force<\/p>\n<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police violence against civilians, is investigating the killing. The SIU has assigned five investigators and one forensic investigator to the case. The two Ottawa police officers named are the subject officers. Five other officers will be interviewed as witnesses. Anyone expecting a semblance of justice, or even minimal accountability, from the SIU will be disappointed. Despite the fact that the unit is held up internationally as a model for police oversight and accountability there are real limitations and documented problems with the SIU. These are related in part to the fact that police, and police associations (they are not unions) regularly interfere with, obstruct, intimidate, and confound SIU investigators and investigations.<\/p>\n<p>Even as the SIU was starting its investigation the head of the Ottawa police association was attempting to skew the interpretation of events, deflect attention from police actions, and diminish police force racism. Not surprisingly association head Matt Skof is offended that issues of racism and race are even being raised. He has attempted to pose racism and racist policing as American issues (again attempting to buttress the Canadian mythologies). In his words: \u201cI\u2019m worried that the conversation is even occurring, to be quite candid\u201d (quoted in Nease 2016b). Once again police and their associations seek to silence critics or simply concerned citizens from even discussing the issues. And this is the aim of their media campaigns and intimidation efforts. For Skof, racism and racist policing are not real, but simply rhetorical. Again, in his words: \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate that we\u2019re seeing the bleeding of that very difficult rhetoric into Canada now\u201d (quoted in Nease 2016b). Skof also finds it \u201cunfortunate\u201d that \u201cthis has become a conversation around a specific community\u201d (quoted in Nease 2016b). The association attempts to pose racism and racist policing as simply rhetoric and apparently un-Canadian rhetoric at that. This is a common ploy for police associations in such cases. Unfortunately, it seems to be an approach that infects all levels of governance in the Canadian state context. The silence from politicians, particularly supposedly progressive ones, is telling.<\/p>\n<p>Skof\u2019s provocative and insensitive comments have drawn justified criticism. Amran Ali, active with the Canadian Somali Mothers Association, said in an interview with CBC News Ottawa responded:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why he felt the need to do that. He could have simply said, he doesn\u2019t need to give an interview, there\u2019s an SIU investigation going on. But he felt it was OK for him, and appropriate, to go on air, and talk to Canada about how Abdirahman deserved what happened to him. Up until then, I was holding it together. &#8230; A loss is a loss, an individual\u2019s life was taken, but up until that interview, I\u2019m not going to say I was OK, but I was able to hold it together.\u201d (quoted in Nease 2016b)<\/p>\n<p>Skof spoke, as association heads do, to impact the public view of the police and to send a message to the SIU and politicians. Any efforts to address police violence will, of necessity, have to openly and aggressively challenge the police associations which are in many ways the hard edge of policing in social war.<\/p>\n<p>The Ottawa police association has found it necessary to act to defend officers on several occasions recently. Numerous Ottawa Police officers have faced charges in the last few years.\u00a0 Two officers were charged with assault when a man was injured while in custody in May 2014. An officer was charged with dangerous driving following a high-speed car chase that put a suspect in hospital in February 2015. Three officers were charged with criminal negligence and breach of duty for seriously injuring three paramedics during a training exercise in June 2014 (Haley and Jackson 2016).<\/p>\n<p>On Tuesday, following Abdi\u2019s death, the National Council of Canadian Muslims released a statement calling for a thorough investigation of the violent arrest (Jay 2016). As NCCM spokesperson Amira Elghawaby put it: \u201cThe community we\u2019re hearing from here in Ottawa \u2014 and across the country \u2014 want answers. So it\u2019s really important that the SIU conducts the investigation thoroughly, transparently\u201d (quoted in Jay 2016). Unfortunately the history of investigations of police killings of civilians in Ontario as elsewhere in Canada leaves little reason for optimism that the police involved will be held in any way accountable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>Already the response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has a different sense than many acts of police violence in Canada recently. The mobilizations, including rallies, demonstrations, public gatherings, in the community and beyond show a rising movement against police violence. Calls that Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman galvanize opposition to police violence, and indeed policing more generally (as inherently violent institutions). The willingness of community members to speak openly and unflinchingly about police violence, particularly within a community subjected to and threatened by ongoing police violence shows the strength of solidarity and care. And this solidarity and care are based partly in the shared experiences of harassment, racism, brutality, and control directed by the state at Somali Canadian communities.<\/p>\n<p>These mobilizations open real possibilities for opposition to state violence and for alternative, real, forms of community safety and security (which police do not provide, nor were they intended to provide, in any event). The neighborhood in which Abdirahmen Abdi lived shows the resources of care on which opposition and alternatives to police will be founded. A stark contrast to the repression and punitiveness of policing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Aylward, Cassie. 2016. \u201c\u2018This is the Hintonburg I Know\u2019: Dozens Gather to Remember Ottawa Man Killed after Violent Arrest.\u201d <em>CFRA<\/em>.

police have extra-judicially executed a man who was only suspected of robbery. The man was shot and killed by police at a condominium parkade in the southeast part of the city, Inglewood. According to police, a resident of the SoBow condominiums called police after believing to have seen four men looking at vehicles. The victim has been identified by friends as Sanjai Prasad (41).<\/p>\n<p>Police blocked off exits of the parkade and entered in search of the men. Police opened fire on a vehicle containing four men. The driver was struck and killed. The other three men were arrested. The vehicle was contained within an empty parking garage and posed no immediate threat to the public. Other details have not been disclosed including why the police believed that vehicle to be stolen or why they thought killing someone was an appropriate response to suspected theft. The condo complex had been the site of a fear and surveillance campaign with notices about a previous theft being circulated and residents being encouraged to call police.<\/p>\n<p>Calgary police immediately began a concerted effort to discredit and smear the victim with public statements about his criminal record (which is irrelevant and does not justify the police execution since they only identified the man after the fact). Yet friends tell a very different, more complete story. According to friend Stacey Halvorsen:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe was a totally genuine, big hearted person. He always put his friends before himself and he was just\u2026 I know what it says about him on his record and stuff, but that\u2019s not how he came across to me, you know? He wasn\u2019t violent. I\u2019ve known him for a really long time and I\u2019ve never seen him angry. He was always happy. Unfortunately, you know, his past is making him look like he&#8217;s a bad guy, and he wasn\u2019t.\u201d (quoted in Anderson 2016)<\/p>\n<p>Prasad was helping a farmer girlfriend raise a young boy.<\/p>\n<p>The trial by media and police orchestrated trials by media have been common tactics. Calgary police have recently been criticized by defense lawyers for running trial by media campaigns in another case (see Bell 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The real issue here is that once again the police are ready and willing to kill in service of their role of defenders of property. Suspected theft should in no way be an executable offense. Yet this defense of property, even over and above the lives of the working class and poor, is the original and foundational function of policing.<\/p>\n<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Team (ASIRT), which investigates acts of violence involving police in the province, will look at the case.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Anderson, Drew. 2016. \u201cSanjai Prasad Identified as Man Shot and Killed by Calgary Police.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

Did Jocelyn George Die in RCMP Custody? (Indigenous People\u2019s Deaths in Custody)","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/07\/04\/why-did-jocelyn-george-die-in-rcmp-custody-indigenous-peoples-deaths-in-custody\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-3Z","content":"<p>In the Canadian context too little attention is given to deaths that occur in police custody. Little is revealed about the circumstances of the deaths and too many questions are left unanswered. This is particularly the case in deaths of Indigenous people in police custody in Canada, occurrences which have been too frequent and too frequently passed over by media and academics alike.<\/p>\n<p>Serious questions remain to be answered regarding the in custody death of Jocelyn Nynah Marsha George (18), a member of the Ahousaht and Hesquiaht First Nations, on the evening of June 24, 2016. The young Indigenous woman died while being held by the RCMP in Port Alberni. She had been arrested on June 23 for uncertain reasons. The BC Coroners Service reported that George was taken to Westcoast General Hospital the next morning \u201cin need of medical attention\u201d of an undisclosed nature. She was then taken by air ambulance to Victoria&#8217;s Royal Jubilee Hospital and died there on the evening of June 24. The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), which investigates all incidents of violence by police against civilians in British Columbia, are investigating.<\/p>\n<p>Jocelyn George\u2019s family members want to know why their loved one was left alone in the cell by RCMP and for how long. They also want to know if or when officers checked on her while she was being held. They would also like to see any video footage from the detachment (Zussman 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>The family reports that Jocelyn George was taken into custody for a \u201cdisturbance\u201d and was left alone in her cell. This raises real questions about police interactions with indigenous people, particularly indigenous youth. It is well documented that Indigenous people are responded to more punitively by police and are detained disproportionately to non-Natives in Canada (see Monchalin 2016). That Jocelyn George was taken into custody over a disturbance should raise flags about issues of police discretion, possible racism or profiling, and punitive policing.<\/p>\n<p>Doctors at the hospital stated that they found a mix of drugs and alcohol in the teenager\u2019s system which may have damaged internal organs. There is no sense yet why the police did not provide care and attention to someone who may have been experiencing distressed health. The family wants the IIO investigation to place focus on the ways in which police officers treat people dealing with addictions and health issues while in custody (Zussman 2016b). She apparently needed help but did not receive it.<\/p>\n<p>George\u2019s uncle Linus Lucas notes the ongoing impact of state violence and the residential school system on the family. These are the histories of Canadian colonialism and genocide that have devastated Indigenous communities and families and in which the RCMP were, and continue to be, central figures. This further informs questions about the lack of attention, care, or compassion George received while in custody. According to Lucas:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn some ways I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not surprising where she ended up, given our own family history. Both my parents are survivors of residential schools. You only know how to deal with things in one manner, and that\u2019s get angry and say what the hell is wrong with you, get your act together, and you are yelling..It just got her more determined to say, \u2018I don&#8217;t have to deal with you and I will do what I want, just leave me alone,\u2019 and it just got harder and harder for us to deal with.\u201d (quoted in Zussman 2016b)<\/p>\n<p>Two young children, four months and three years old, are left without their mother. She is fondly remembered by family members who recall a sweet girl. According to Christopher Cenmane, the father of her four-month-old daughter: \u201cShe was too young to say goodbye. I will always love her. I will always have her living in my heart. She is young, beautiful, smart. She will always be my love\u201d (quoted in CBC 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly, but in manner too common in cases of police involved deaths of civilians, the family was not even notified by police that their loved one had been taken to hospital. The family reports that they would not have known at all about the situation if an Indigenous hospital worker had not called to tell them (Zussman 2016b).<\/p>\n<p>In the words of the victim\u2019s cousin Lee Lucas: \u201cWe know she was brought in and they said she was okay, and she was found in the morning. Our main concern is to find out what happened in the time between when she was arrested and when the ambulance picked her up\u201d (quoted in Zussman 2016a).<\/p>\n<p>The family hopes the investigation will address police protocols for interacting with people dealing with addictions and\/or health care issues. According to Lee Lucas: \u201cIf things can change from this, if cop protocols can change from this when they bring someone in who has issues like this&#8230;You have got to look at how they are brought in and why they are not checked out\u201d (quoted in Zussman 2016a). Again questions remain to be asked why police are taking custody of people in health crises and why alternative care and support are not made available rather than police and detention. And why are police allowed to impose penalty and punishment in these cases in any event?<\/p>\n<p>Jocelyn George\u2019s cousin further points out that such punitive policing is especially deployed against Indigenous people and it is taking a brutal toll. In her words: \u201cSometimes things have to change because this is happening far too much especially for our people in this province\u201d (quoted in Zussman 2016a). Change must come and directly.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone waiting for or expecting answers or police accountability from the IIO are likely to be disappointed. The agency, which has a connection with training through the Justice Institute of BC police academy has taken exceedingly long times to complete investigations and does not have a good record of finding against police involved in civilian deaths in the province.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>CBC. 2016. \u201c18-Year-Old Port Alberni Woman Dies in Police Custody.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.

is much to learn in the present period from the social conditions and social and political struggles of the 1930s. It, like today, was a period of economic crisis, austerity, authoritarianism, and repression. The austerity regimes of the last four decades have dismantled much of the social safety net systems of welfare, social housing, unemployment insurance, and educational grants built up through the social struggles, like those of unemployed workers and the On to Ottawa Trek of the 1930s. The result has been a return to conditions of social isolation and regulation, individualization and privatization that characterized state capitalist policy and practices in the period of economic crisis of the 1930s.<\/p>\n<p>One outcome of the period of neoliberal austerity has been the turn away from social welfare systems that view housing, welfare, etc. as social rights available to all on the basis of need (with obvious restrictions in terms of nationalist residency and citizenship) to a neoliberal system that views these as privileges available only to those who prove deserving (typically through their willingness to labor for the state or capital). Another outcome of neoliberalism has been the privatization of social services either in businesses, NGOs, or churches and religious organizations. A further outcome has been the increase in repression and the expansion f repressive institutions, from surveillance to police to prisons to community corrections to regulate and punish especially the poorest and most deprived as well as the increase in repressive force against organizations that challenge and contest the status quo and dominant forces.<\/p>\n<p>These outcomes of the austerity politics of the present share stark similarities with socio-political conditions of the 1930s. The response of the Canadian government to mass unemployment and poverty was repression and regulation in the service of accumulation. In order to secure some shelter, food, and minimal pay, single unemployed workers were placed in labor camps and put to hard labor doing the work of infrastructure building according to the needs of the state and industry.<\/p>\n<p>Notably the work camps were explicit elements of social war and had a specifically military character. On the whole the state response to unemployed workers and the response to organizing and resistance by unemployed workers shows the nature of social war and capitalist regulatory regimes for accumulation within the Canadian context.<\/p>\n<p>This repressive workfare approach very much motivated the Conservative government of R.B, Bennett in the 1930s and motivated much of their response to unemployed workers and the On to Ottawa trekkers. And the Conservative government was fully prepared to use social war means, including lethal military force, to impose workfare discipline on unemployed workers and to break collective resistance movements. In upholding the state capitalist status quo the police in Regina would kill unemployed worker Nick Schaack in what is known, infamously, as the Regina Riot, a military police riot against striking camp workers and their supporters.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>No Relief: Forced Labor Camps and the Regulation of the Unemployed<\/p>\n<p>The economic crises of the Great Depression and the mass scale of unemployment left one in nine citizens in Canada relying on relief (Zuehlke 1996). Relief was not provided as a human or civil right but was rather meted out as a combined form of regulation, punishment, and forced labor by the Conservative Government of R.B. Bennett. The Bennett Government ordered the Department of National Defence to construct and manage work camps in which single unemployed men were put to work building roads and bridges, digging ditches, and undertaking other public works projects as condition of receiving relief. And that relief came at a rate of twenty cents per day.<\/p>\n<p>In addition the tough, often unsafe and unhealthy work was done in the absence of adequate first aid or medical resources at work sites or in the camps. Furthermore, the work of the camps was not covered under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act which offered some protections for workers in cases of job related injuries or illnesses.<\/p>\n<p>Terrible working and living conditions in the militarily managed camps were matched with undemocratic regulation. Unemployed workers in the camps organized committees and representation but these were ignored by the military and government. Unemployed people in the camps were disenfranchised losing what they believed was a right to vote. \u00a0All of this prepared grounds for dissatisfaction and unrest against camp management and the government.<\/p>\n<p>The Workers&#8217; Unity League (WUL), active in a range of working class struggles of the day worked to help unemployed workers in the camps form a Relief Camp Workers&#8217; Union (RCWU) in 1933. They would organize a strike over conditions in and management in the camps. In December of 1934 unemployed camp workers abandoned the camps for a mass demonstration against the government in Vancouver, home of Prime Minister Bennett\u2019s constituency office. In response the government offered first policing and then the promise of a government commission to investigate the concerns of camp workers. Purely a ploy to dissipate the movement by the government the promised commission never materialized. A second strike was organized for April 4, 1935. A mass movement by this point more than 1600 striking camp workers travelled to Vancouver (Waiser 2003).<\/p>\n<p>The striking camp workers took forward a range of targeted demands that addressed the many concerns facing workers in the camps. The primary demands included pay and working condition improvements: wages of 50 cents per hour (up from 25 cents) for unskilled work; union wages for skilled work; guarantees of 120 hours of work per month; and Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act coverage for all camp workers. There were also demands over governance and rights for camp workers. These included: recognition by camp management and government of the democratically elected workers\u2019 committees; restoration of the right to vote in elections for camp workers. The strikers also called for the camps to be taken out of the control of the Department of National Defence. Notably the RCWU strikers also called for the rescinding of the notorious Section 98 of the Criminal Code, an explicitly anti-communist provision passed to repress opposition to government initiated as part of the earlier Red Scare and state violence at the time of the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919.<\/p>\n<p>Public support for the relief camp strikers was massive. Governments at all levels failed to respond instead attempting to pass responsibility from one level to another. Bennett refused to travel to Vancouver to meet with any delegation of workers. He was in hiding. Receiving no adequate response to their initiative and no answer to their demands the strikers determined to take their movement and demands directly to the federal government in Ottawa. Their figurehead would be the outstanding organizer Arthur \u201cSlim\u201d Evans.<\/p>\n<p>On June 3, 1935, hundreds of striking camp workers and unemployed people in Vancouver loaded onto boxcars heading east. What would become known as the \u201cOn to Ottawa Trek,\u201d one of the great oppositional movements in working class history in the Canadian state context, was born. The Trek would end less than a month later in an infamous act of police state violence and the murder of an unemployed worker, Nick Schaack<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On to Ottawa<\/p>\n<p>The government, and particularly the Department of National Defence, seems to have anticipated winning a war of attrition in which the On to Ottawa Trek would disintegrate as trekkers became bored, tired, hungry, and\/or cold, giving rise to feelings of hopelessness and demoralization.<\/p>\n<p>This result never happened much to the growing concern of authorities. The rising support of local residents along the train route lifted the spirits of the trekkers and showed the mutual aid on which working class resistance has always relied for sustenance.<\/p>\n<p>The stop in Golden, British Columbia on June six and seven, 1935 was particularly rejuvenating for the trekkers. It showed the support the organized unemployed had secured. A local farmer Mrs. Sorely formed a committee of the local Workers\u2019 Protective Association and organized area farmers and townsfolk to prepare food and provisions for the arriving strikers. Trekker Ronald Liversedge recalls:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was incredible, it was heartwarming, it was beautiful.<\/p>\n<p>The column of men halted, a thunderous cheer arose, and the men broke ranks and rushed over to embrace those quiet smiling, wonderful women of Golden. The little whitehaired woman had, with the aid of our advance committee, mobilized the farmers in that valley of Golden. With only twenty-four hours to work on, they had procured here a calf, there a quarter of beef, there potatoes, there carrots, turnips, onions, all in huge quantities, set all the women to baking bread, collecting cooking utensils, plates and mugs, with the end result which welcomed us on our arrival. All this had been accomplished with an absence of fuss and bother.<\/p>\n<p>The people of Golden knew about us, and our struggles; they knew about the relief camps. Their welcome of us was the welcome of pioneers, heartfelt, deep, and sincere. Golden stood out in the memory of the trekkers as the most restful, tranquil episode of the whole trek.<\/p>\n<p>Quickly the camp workers jumped in to relieve the men and women who had worked so hard to greet us. Squads of cooks, waiters, fire tenders, and water carriers were soon organized, and before long dinner was served. That never-to-be-forgotten meal! The weather was ideal, the outdoor site was superb, and our hosts were salt of the earth.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 149)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That the organized unemployed generally and the On to Ottawa trekkers specifically were viewed by the government through a social war framework is clear in the fact that the Department of National Defence kept steady watch on them. Reports were regularly filed to the National Defence Headquarters.<\/p>\n<p>Notably the trekkers were not engaging in misbehavior or troublemaking. The District Officer Commanding for Military District Thirteen (Alberta and Eastern British Columbia) and the Officer Commanding in Regina both remarked upon the solid discipline, excellent organization, and decent conduct of the trekkers. And, of certain concern to the government if not the military they noted the favorable impression the trekkers made on the general public (Brown 1987, 150\u2013151).<\/p>\n<p>For their part the trekkers stayed on a specific strategic message focusing on their specific grievances and consistently stated demands upon the government rather than broader ideational or propaganda messages for radical social transformation which many of them, as well as their supporters, actually desired. In a leaflet distributed in Calgary the trekkers stayed on point with their focused appeals. It read in part: \u201cWe invite all political, economic, cultural and church organizations to give us their support in our just fight for the abolition of the present relief camp system\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 154). They stayed true to their message and communicated it to one and all.<\/p>\n<p>Their honesty was matched with a direct action approach. The military and provincial politicians in Alberta became tweaked when trekkers occupied and barricaded themselves inside of a Calgary Relief Office along with the Provincial Relief Officer, A.A. McKenzie, and Dr. Stanley the Conservative MP for Calgary East. The direct action occupation had won the trekkers $600 in meal tickets from municipal authorities on direction from the Alberta government.<\/p>\n<p>McKenzie wrote almost immediately to the federal Labour Minister Gordon in breathless terms warning of a revolutionary tide. In the words of his wire this was placed in military terms:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRegarding British Columbia single men. A dangerous revolutionary army intimidating and defying provincial and municipal governments by threats and actually holding officials as hostage until demands met. Their success having a far reaching effect that may be difficult to control.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 155).<\/p>\n<p>Others in the military were also on alert. The local Officer Commanding reported to Ottawa his concerns following the support picnic on June 9. He warned: \u201cSpeaker today said public militant action will be taken by men any time needs no agreed to\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 155). This concern of authorities seemed confirmed by the occupation of the Relief Office. His report also stirred government concern about a growing movement that would be bolstered if it ever reached Winnipeg. He reported: \u201cTalk amongst men this is revolutionary movement, large numbers expected to join at Winnipeg and Toronto\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 155).<\/p>\n<p>Of real worry to the government was that the Trek was gaining widespread and growing support among the public and much of the mainstream press. Local authorities in Calgary were the ones being chastised for responding in such a panicked fashion to the unemployed. Notably the bugaboo of communism was not frightening the public or turning public opinion against the trekkers whose demands were so straightforward and viewed as legitimate. When the Trek left Calgary it had grown by hundreds of participants including a large group who had come from Edmonton after being cut off of relief for refusing to go to the camps.<\/p>\n<p>The social and political context was one which was perilous for the ruling Conservative Party. The Conservatives had been virtually erased as a political presence in almost every province (Brown 1987, 151). The Bennett government reached levels still among the least popular governments in Canadian history. They were living on borrowed time even if they could not see it themselves.<\/p>\n<p>The federal government came to the decision to stop the trekkers in Saskatchewan while the trekkers were still in Alberta. The success of the trekkers in Calgary and the popular public support they received there convinced the Bennett government that the Trek, far from losing steam and fizzling out, was gaining both momentum and support. In Calgary thousands of dollars were raised for the trekkers and a picnic was held in their honor. And the prospects for a huge boost in support and recognition were looming with arrival in Winnipeg, home of the Winnipeg General Strike and historic hotbed of working class radicalism in the West.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On to Regina<\/p>\n<p>The Trek arrived in Saskatchewan on June 12. They had been preceded by advance teams who had secured accommodations and meal tickets for use at restaurants and made connections with local support groups. Public meetings were held in Swift Current and Moose Jaw, the first stops in the province, to let people know about the trekkers\u2019 demands and aims. The plan for trekkers was to stay no more than two or three days in Regina and then continue east.<\/p>\n<p>The trekkers landed in Regina on June 14, their numbers now swelled to about 1800 with anticipated arrival of hundreds more from a large camp at Dundurn outside of Saskatoon (Brown 1987, 160). The public were solidly behind the trekkers with a large Citizen\u2019s Emergency Relief Committee operating to provide emotional and material support to the movement.<\/p>\n<p>The police and military were watching and in communication with the government about events on the ground. District Officer Commanding, Brigadier Boak, reported on June 14 and June 15 of the broad support shown for the trekkers by both the public and city officials in Regina (Brown 1987, 160).<\/p>\n<p>A mass gathering of 6000 turned up for a public meeting at the exhibition stadium to support the trekkers and hear about their demands and plans. The meeting passed three resolutions. One condemned PM Bennett\u2019s decision to halt the Trek. Another asked for formal protest from the opposition parties against the Conservative government\u2019s decision to send more police to Regina. The final resolution condemned the Conservative MP for Regina, F.N. Turnbull who had suggested that the militia be called in against the trekkers (Brown 1987, 161). The latter point highlights the government\u2019s readiness to deal with the strikers militarily with force.<\/p>\n<p>Slim Evans noted that the Trek was not only interested in in meeting with Bennett. They wanted to educate the public on conditions in the camps and build support for the unemployed on a broader basis. In his words in Regina: \u201cBut we\u2019re not in a hurry to go down and see Mr. Bennett. We want to stop at all the cities along the way and tell citizens of the hopelessness of the relief camp situation\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 161). And the people very much wanted to hear it.<\/p>\n<p>By the time the trekkers entered Saskatchewan the Bennett government was nearing a crisis level. Deeply unpopular it was losing its legitimacy in the eyes of the public at a growing pace. Even more, many were beginning to question the very legitimacy of the capitalist state itself (Brown 1987, 156). The <em>Calgary Albertan<\/em> published an editorial which openly condemned the government. Referring to McKenzie\u2019s complaints about the Relief Office occupation it read in part:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe might have been the victim of a less disciplined, less organized body of men. But he was not; he really was co-victim with them of a Government at Ottawa which deferred men\u2019s hopes\u2014all our hopes\u2014so often, promised us so much and given us so little that at length the chief sufferers have determined to go to Ottawa and ask the Prime Minister himself what he proposed to do about it.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 156)<\/p>\n<p>The Regina <em>Leader-Post<\/em> pointed out the bankruptcy of the government\u2019s approach and their reliance on violence:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe camp strikers have become a body of national importance and the Dominion Government appears to have no policy except that of force.<\/p>\n<p>So far as Saskatchewan is concerned the people who made it possible for the strikers to reach here by rail had better concern themselves with methods to get them out, and to get them out in the orderly fashion in which they came in.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 161)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Regina was determined to be the strategically beneficial spot to stop the Trek for the now desperate government. The RCMP training depot is situated there along with a large active RCMP force. Regina was also viewed as having a small organized labor movement, less radical than that of Winnipeg (Brown 1987). For the government the Trek had to be stopped before it could reach the center of working class radicalism in Winnipeg.<\/p>\n<p>The decision to stop the Trek was opposed and derided by the public, mass media, opposition parties, and the provincial government in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan government had made plans to provide food and accommodation to trekkers while they were in the province.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Provocative Governance: Preparing a Riot in Regina<\/p>\n<p>The federal government prepared to use both the militia and the regular army against the trekkers. There was some concern though about the readiness of the local militia to attack the unemployed.<\/p>\n<p>When word came out on June 15 that the railway was acting against trespassing the trekkers determined to leave Regina by freight on June 17. They put out a request to residents of Regina to attend the railway yards to keep police from intervening against the trekkers. The trekkers knew the stakes. In a leaflet they stated: \u201cOnly the mass support of Regina citizens will force the Authorities to keep their hands off us on our way to Ottawa\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 164).<\/p>\n<p>While the provincial government tried to reaffirm its control over the police so as to allow the trekkers to leave, the federal Justice Minister Hugh Guthrie again reasserted the federal government\u2019s authority over the RCMP and federal jurisdiction in the matter (Brown 1987, 163).<\/p>\n<p>As the June 17 clash loomed, the federal government announced it was sending the Minister of Railways, Dr. R.J. Marin, and the Minister of Agriculture, Robert Weir, to Regina to hear the trekkers\u2019 concerns. They would arrive there on the 17<sup>th<\/sup>. Still RCMP Assistant Commissioner Wood mobilized his forces to prevent boarding of trains and arranged with CPR to cancel the eastbound freight scheduled to leave Regina. The Riot Act was going to be read (Brown 1987, 164).<\/p>\n<p>In a telegram to the federal Minister of Justice, the Premier suggested that the federal government was setting the stage for, even actively provoking, a riot. Indeed the federal government actions seemed designed solely to spark a riot\u2014giving the government the excuse to unleash extreme repressive violence against the trekkers.<\/p>\n<p>The tension on June 17 would be somewhat lifted on news that Slim Evans and seven other representatives of the Trek would meet with Marion and Weir. At the meeting Marion raised the proposal that Trek representatives travel to Ottawa to meet with the Bennett cabinet. The proposal was taken to the trekkers for discussion and for decision. After much debate a mass meeting of trekkers decided that a delegation of eight trekkers would travel to Ottawa. Many were concerned that this was only a government stall tactic to both separate some organizers from the mass group and to secure time to prepare an assault by police. The decision to halt the Trek while a delegation traveled to Ottawa would prove disastrous for the Trek though it was well received by the public and the mainstream press.<\/p>\n<p>The Bennett government now had an opportunity to see a voluntary disbanding of the Trek. But to do so they would have to compromise and make some real concessions and provide real results. The RCWU was willing to listen to and respond positively to reasonable offers. Bennett would have benefited his government in an election year by gaining some public goodwill and legitimacy in the eyes of the mass media.<\/p>\n<p>Tellingly the influence of the RCMP and the military played key parts in keeping the government from reaching a compromise. For the RCMP and Department of National Defence the organized unemployed were communist agitators who could not, and should not, be reasoned with. Should never be accommodate, and by nature threatened legitimate (i.e. government) authority. This position restricted what little inclination the government might have had for a mutually agreeable settlement. For the military forces and government, the communists must get nothing.<\/p>\n<p>The RCMP officials acted on the assumption that talks would fail. From the start of the planned Ottawa meeting they pushed for a violent police intervention. Assistant RCMP Commissioner Wood even worked up a detailed plan to stop the Trek by force and repress the trekkers. On June 8 he communicated this plan to RCMP Commissioner MacBrien (Brown 1987, 170). He stated: \u201cEnergetic police action in this operation would, I am sure, have liquidated this movement, for a large percentage are boys who never have been in a relief camp and have joined this movement as they would a circus, not realizing what it was all about or what was back of it\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 170). One might again note the patronizing view of unemployed workers held by the government and their wishful thinking about the composition of the movement. One might also note the liquidationist social war language.<\/p>\n<p>The meeting between the Trek delegation and the federal cabinet occurred on June 22, 1935. It did not go well. Evans noted that the issue of the camps was systemic rather than limited to specific grievances He also raised concerns that an additional 60 RCMP troops had been transferred to Regina while the delegation was away, in violation of the agreed to terms for the meeting (Brown 1987, 170).<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly in his time Bennett first asked where each of the delegates had been born. He then raised questions about the delegates on the basis of all but Evans having been born outside Canada. The xenophobia and racism of the Bennett government would not be concealed even in this meeting. That the government turned immediately to nationalist xenophobia showed their racist framework but also their reliance on divide and conquer approaches to working class unity.<\/p>\n<p>Said Bennett during the meeting:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have listened with much interest as to what you men have had to say. With the exception of one of you, who has a record that we will not discuss, you were born outside Canada, and in the country from which you came I was told the other day there are one million men who have no work and never will have. In this country we have been passing through the same period of depression as the rest of the world.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 172)<\/p>\n<p>Bennett then went on a red baiting rant against communism, \u201cSoviet Committees,\u201d the WUL, and the whole project of unemployed organizing. What really bothered him was a \u201crising against law and against the institutions of our country\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 173). \u00a0This unleashed a diatribe against the delegates. Bennett railed:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou have not shown much anxiety to get work, not much anxiety to get work. It is the one thing you do not want. What you want is this adventure in the hope that the organization which you are promoting in Canada may be able to over-awe government and break down the forces that represent law and order. I never thought that I would come to the day when I would hear a Canadian at any rate say that a country that sends its policemen west or east for the purpose of maintaining law in the country is going to be subjected to censure on the part of those who themselves admit they are violators of the law, admitted here today. The police have moved west; they have moved east; they will move in increasing numbers whenever it is necessary to maintain law. Take that down.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 173)<\/p>\n<p>Bennett, in an anti-communist furor, rejected any recognition of elected camp committees as a plot to establish Soviets in the camps. Tellingly the Prime Minister refused to take the camps out of DND control. Finally Bennett ignored the advice of Manion and offered the trekkers nothing in the way of even limited compromise.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A 1930s Solution: Military Containment Camps for the Unemployed<\/p>\n<p>Federal DND and RCMP officials put the plan to stop the Trek into action on June 22, even as the delegation was meeting with the federal cabinet. In Winnipeg 860 new men had requested to join the Trek and authorities feared those numbers would swell over 1000 if the Trek reached the city.<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly the government planned, in 1930s fashion, a containment camp to hold trekkers. The military character and focus on labor regulation of the camps was clear. On June 24 the District Officer Commanding in Regina, Brigadier Boak, was ordered to establish the detention camp at Lumsden, 20 miles from Regina (Brown 1987, 179). By June 25 the special camp had been built and was ready for inmates.<\/p>\n<p>The Lumsden camp would be policed by the RCMP and administered by the military while being formally under the purview of the federal Department of Labour (largely for public relations purposes). Assistant Commissioner Wood of the RCMP framed it in these terms: \u201cAbsolutely essential that housing and particularly feeding be handed over to National Defence Department in order to secure control and liquidate movement\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 179). Note the liquidationist language used repeatedly by the federal government. The trekkers were to be forced explicitly into military containment camps from which they would be dispersed to other work camps. The state capitalist nexus of military detention, forced labor, and social war is inescapably clear in this case. Work would make them free?<\/p>\n<p>In Regina the RCMP had amassed its own force of 340 officers. Railway and city police would bring those numbers to around 500 (Brown 1987, 181). While the military would have been mobilized in open social war against the trekkers the large police force available made this not immediately necessary. Police forces were entirely suitable for waging this campaign of social war.<\/p>\n<p>To force the trekkers to Lumsden the federal government cut off meal tickets unless the recipients went to the camp. That the government considered creating conditions for a police riot as an excuse to unleash police violence is clear. Assistant Commissioner Wood, in a report to Commissioner MacBrien suggested a police provocation would leave the trekkers with no choice but Lumsden. In his words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is not expected that there will be many voluntary registrations tomorrow and that sooner or later there will be a demonstration in front of Mr. Burgess\u2019 office which will bring about Police action. The situation is suitable for our purposes in that it is opposite the armouries and there is a large open space in all directions surrounding the building where we could use mounted men to advantage.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 182)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The RCMP were ordered not to allow trekkers to leave the city or province even by vehicle or on foot. A truck and two cars raised by trekkers to travel to Manitoba were intercepted outside of Regina with all drivers and passengers arrested by the RCMP, the vehicles impounded (Brown 1987, 185).<\/p>\n<p>Five of the travellers arrested leaving Regina were charged under the infamous Section 98 anti-communist legislation. On June 28 the federal government decided to apply Section 98 to members of the RCWU which was declared an illegal association. The Trek leaders were to be arrested as would anyone claiming membership in the RCWU.<\/p>\n<p>Even as the trekkers had decided to organize an orderly retreat under their own efforts back to their camps, the government was pushing the RCMP to proceed with Section 98 arrests. It was still not certain there was any legal basis for doing so. Showing its real intentions, even at this point the government refused to allow any negotiation with the trekkers in their attempts to disband of their own accord. For the federal government the only option was containment and dispersal from the special detention camp.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Police Riot in Regina and the Killing of Trekker Nick Schaack<\/p>\n<p>The RCMP decided to arrest Trek leaders at a mass rally being held at Market Square on the evening of July 1, appropriately the nationalist \u201cCanada Day.\u201d The meeting was arranged to inform allies and residents in Regina of the status of the Trek. It was geared to non-trekkers. Almost 2000 people would show up to hear the speeches and gain updates on the Trek. Only around 200 of these were trekkers, most, aware of the Trek\u2019s status, having decided to stay at the exhibition grounds. The vast majority of attendees were local residents curious about the Trek and supportive of it. Having prepared the ground to launch a police riot, the police would choose this moment and place, filled with non-trekkers, to carry out a bloodbath.<\/p>\n<p>The RCMP never provided an explanation, even in the following inquiry, why they did not simply wait until the end of the rally to arrest leaders after the crowd had left (Brown 1987, 192). What seems clear is that Assistant Commissioner Wood wanted to seize this opportunity to make a show of force to trekkers and the supportive public more broadly (Brown 1987, 193). Why else attempt to arrest seven men in the middle of a mass rally of people supportive of the targeted men and their actions? The intent was clearly to humiliate the trekkers while sending a message of terror to other organized and organizing unemployed from Winnipeg to Qu\u00e9bec.<\/p>\n<p>Plainclothes officers were situated throughout the crowd with several near the speaker\u2019s platform. The square was surrounded by RCMP forces in furniture vans. Mounted officers were positioned two blocks from the square. City police were at the ready inside the garage of the Regina Police Station located directly at the edge of the square (Brown 1987, 192).<\/p>\n<p>The police assault on civilians began in chaos. Two troops of ECMP officers left their vans before the sounding of the supposed signal whistle. With the sound of the whistle the haphazard, prematurely launched, assault was joined by officers of the city police who quickly took to the crowd armed with baseball bats. RCMP forces advanced on the square and were taken up in hand to hand combat with civilian attendees (Brown 1987, 193).<\/p>\n<p>According to the Regina <em>Daily Star<\/em> report:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA whistle blew. The four doors of the city garage at the rear of the headquarters building, not 100 feet from the speakers stand, swung upward with a clatter and blue uniformed, helmeted constables, as well as plainclothes officers, ran out waving \u201cbaseball bat\u201d batons overhead. People began to run.\u201d (quoted in Stone 1967, 83)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As police violently cleared the square the battle spread into nearby neighborhoods with most trying to leave while others tried to defend retreating civilians against continuing police assaults. Cars were overturned and used as barricade. Rocks were thrown to slow the advancing troops.<\/p>\n<p>Police began firing on the civilians wounding several people. There was no gunfire from residents or trekkers\u2014they had no guns (Brown 1987, 194). Numerous eyewitnesses would report random assaults on bystanders by police who, sometimes in small gangs, simply attacked people without cause (Brown 1987, 194). The Regina Riot lasted more than two hours with police assaults slowing down only by 11 PM. More than 100 people were arrested.<\/p>\n<p>The RCMP then laid siege to the Exhibition Stadium where most trekkers were staying. In an attempt to starve the trekkers out the military police refused food or water to people inside the facilities. Machine gun units were trained on the building, encircling it.<\/p>\n<p>By July 5 arrangements had been made for trekkers to leave the city in two special trains of the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railways. The On to Ottawa Trek was over.<\/p>\n<p>One trekker, Nick Schaack, simply an unemployed worker hoping for a better life, was dead, murdered by police who wanted violence, a victim of social war. Schaack, a worker up from the United States seeking work, was badly injured by police during their assault. Instead of giving him medical treatment for a serious head injury or taking him directly to hospital police threw him in jail where he lingered for several hours. Sadly he would die days later of the injuries inflicted upon him by police. Incredibly the police acted to cover up their responsibility for killing Schaack and his death was not associated with the riot until sometime later (possibly years). Not recognized as the working class victim of social war he was, Nick Schaack was placed in a grave that remained unmarked for 76 years. His name has still been largely forgotten in Canadian history.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>States of Exception: Flimsy Democracy and the Conservative Government<\/p>\n<p>The Bennett government took the decision to stop the Trek in Saskatchewan on their own without consultation with the Government of Saskatchewan and against that government\u2019s wishes. The Premier of Saskatchewan was only informed by the Assistant Commissioner of the RCMP.<\/p>\n<p>In Regina Bennett violated his own previously, and repeatedly, stated policy of not intervening unless officially called upon to do so by a provincial government. Yet he would intervene in Regina against the preference of the Saskatchewan government. Furthermore the Province maintained that policing and law enforcement were provincial responsibilities and the RCMP as the provincial force in Saskatchewan was under order of the Attorney-General. If the law was broken the province and police would act as they always did.<\/p>\n<p>The federal government actively sought to, and did, circumvent this order of command by invoking the Railway Act which would give Ottawa authority to call in the RCMP. Bennett\u2019s position had been that illegal trespass on CPR and CNR property was an issue for the railway companies and the provincial governments. But this view changed with the Trek in Saskatchewan and government crisis rising. The government used the excuse of a request for aid from the railways against trespassing. Yet that request came a day after Bennett\u2019s decision had been made and seems to have been compelled by the government in any event. No request was made to the Province for assistance which was proper protocol given that the police would have been under provincial jurisdiction.<\/p>\n<p>RCMP Commissioner MacBrien instructed the Assistant Commissioner in Regina to ignore the Premier and Attorney-General and carry out any federal orders as rail trespass was under federal jurisdiction and within the federal-provincial agreement on policing (Brown 1987, 162). MacBrien directed Wood: \u201cAgreement expressly stated Mounted Police to remain a Dominion force. Also that federal policing duties are excepted from direction of Attorney-General\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 162). Wood was also told that if needed he was to swear in railway police as special RCMP constables. He was also directed to prepare for the reading of the Riot Act and to do so himself as a Justice of the Peace if he could not find provincial or municipal officials willing to do so.<\/p>\n<p>According to Premier Gardiner the federal government was acting in violation of the country\u2019s own constitution. In his words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis constitutes taking the right to instruct police in matters of administrative justice entirely out of our hands. In our opinion your action may result in causing a riot in this province endangering life and property. A letter just handed to the government by the police to the effect that preparations be made to read the Riot Act indicates you hold the same view. We protest your action as being unconstitutional and would state that your lack of action before these men left British Columbia to bring two forces to grips in Regina was bound to produce a riot in Saskatchewan if the present orders are carried out. We strongly protest this flouting of the constitutional rights of the province and would once more ask you to reconsider your position. Your appeal to us to cooperate in every way to protect lives and property as well as to maintain law and order has been made most difficult to comply with as you have taken unto yourself all the power consigned to the government under the B.N.A Act to deal with such matters.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 165)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Manion expressed dismay with Premier Gardiner\u2019s position and offered a thinly veiled threat against him should he not support an assault by CPR police. In Marion\u2019s own words: \u201cI expressed great surprise at his attitude, and said that he would be taking a very great responsibility, if he aided and abetted revolution in any such manner\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 165).<\/p>\n<p>Again, the primary concern for the Conservative government was putting down a popular working class movement at any cost\u2014even against the concerns of other levels of government. And the formalities of democracy would not stand in the way, as they typically do not when liberal democratic governments seek to impose repressive measures on elements of the population deemed oppositional.<\/p>\n<p>Bennett refused emergency debate on the situation requested by opposition members of parliament and there was no debate on a petition from British Columbia with 10,800 signatures calling for Election Act amendments to ensure that relief camp workers had the right to vote tabled by MP Angus MacInnis in May (Brown 1987, 152).<\/p>\n<p>As the federal government took over more and more police functions under provincial jurisdiction they took on the appearance of an extralegal (fascistic) entity. Incredibly, RCMP leadership were not even certain of the legality of their actions in the province, given the federal assumption of provincial authority. Finally the government declared a national emergency to justify its usurpation of authority<\/p>\n<p>The government made use of a phony, fraudulent \u201corder in council\u201d to effect special measures and Section 98. That order came under a provision of the Relief Act stating: \u201cthe Governor in Council my, when Parliament is not in session, take all such measures as in his discretion may be deemed advisable to maintain, within the competence of Parliament, peace, order and good government throughout Canada\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 185).<\/p>\n<p>This was a fascist turn of governance removing decision making from parliamentary oversight and giving power unilaterally to the Governor in Council. Yet no order-in-council had been passed nor could it have been since Parliament <em>was<\/em> sitting and thus there was no legal authority for the order-in-council.<\/p>\n<p>Yet RCMP acted in laying Section 98 charges against trekkers. The feds had taken authority for themselves outside of the law and Parliament. The force even stated publicly that they were acting on legal authority conferred by order-in-council (an order that did not exist and would not have been legal in any event).<\/p>\n<p>A report in the Toronto <em>Daily Star<\/em> suggested that Prime Minister Bennett had scrapped the Magna Carta and put Canada \u201cin the unique position of operating a criminal law which the government refuses to make public\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 187\u2013188).<\/p>\n<p>In times of open social war the state of exception prevails. The public order-in-council campaign did have the effect of dissuading people from aiding the trekkers which was now prohibited by RCMP order. No one in government or policing clarified publicly that there had been no order-in-council.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Red Scares and a War against Communism<\/p>\n<p>Like the miners of Bienfait, Saskatchewan who had been fatally assaulted by the RCMP in 1931, the organized unemployed had support from the Workers Unity League (WUL). Support from the WUL, the RCWU, and the Communist Party helped them build connections and support from a range of Leftist community groups along the Trek route. These included groups like the Canadian Labour Defence League and community associations like the Ukrainian Farmer-Labour Temple Association (Brown 1987, 151). The local support groups provided food, shelter, meeting spaces, print services, and funds (Brown 1987, 151).<\/p>\n<p>The desire to smash Leftist groups and working class resistance was an obsession for the Conservative government. And Bennett used the community supports as an opportunity to red bash the trekkers, and organized unemployed more broadly.<\/p>\n<p>PM Bennett was explicit and arrogantly so in asserting that he would not engage with trekkers because of support they had from communists. In his words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI need hardly say that there are several well known communistic societies under varying names; they have sought to embroil the government in some discussion in respect to these matters, and we have declined to enter into any discussion with them.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 153)<\/p>\n<p>Manion viewed the organizers as extremists and wrote to Bennett two days before the meeting with the delegation to suggest that repressive violence was necessary. In his words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy conviction is that this Communistic crowd who are leading the more or less innocent unemployed are determined to stir up what would be practically a revolution and I feel that undoubtedly strong measures will have to be taken to curb this movement. Somehow the leaders should be got at and if possible got out of the position of leading these unemployed.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 168\u2013169)<\/p>\n<p>Prime Minister Bennett accused the provincial government of coddling communists. His words to the Premier:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHave not the slightest intention of withdrawing from the position which we have taken and proposed to use our utmost endeavour even though you decline to cooperate to maintain the fabric of our society and the institutions of the country against the illegal threats and demands of communists and their associates.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 184)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Bennett described the trekkers in a PR campaign as having \u201csinister purposes\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 180). The sinister plan was of course of communist nature. Fumed Bennett to Parliament: \u201cin reality an organized effort on the part of the various communist organizations throughout Canada to effect the overthrow of constituted authority in defiance of the laws of the land\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 180). This is ironic given the disregard shown for the constitution and the \u201claws of the land\u201d throughout this episode by the Bennett government.<\/p>\n<p>These statements were only part of a broader Red Scare campaign launched by the government, RCMP, and military and repeated in mainstream media. This included replays of the personal, xenophobic, smears about Trek leaders being born outside Canada.<\/p>\n<p>On June 28 the federal government made anti-communism the priority for law and policing with the invoking of Section 98. As the Toronto <em>Daily Star<\/em> reported, simply being a trekker would now render one a communist in the eyes of the law. Its report read:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll strikers holding membership in any of the strike organizations are to be considered communists, it was officially stated at R.C.M.P. headquarters today. Under this ruling, Section 98 of the Criminal Code is being invoked and any striker tying to trek from one province to another is considered a Communist and liable to arrest as such. Any person giving aid or comfort to any such person is also liable to prosecution. R.C.M.P. senior officers said this included the relief camp workers\u2019 associations and similar bodies which are affiliated with the Workers\u2019 Unity League. The leaders are declared to be known Communists.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 187)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Clearly breaking any resistance was the government aim and Red Scare tactics would be the means. This was a rather cheap effort to red bait the public into turning on the trekkers by attempting to link them with communists, rather than simply being aggrieved working class people and victims of capitalism. It was also an effort to delegitimize the RCWU and organized unemployed workers more broadly. Notably communists had higher standing and regard among the general public than did the Bennett Conservative government.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Aftermath<\/p>\n<p>In the days weeks, and months after the police assault the federal government continued its ongoing attempts to distort their role in fomenting the riot and to slander the trekkers and their efforts. Justice Minister Hugh Guthrie lied to Parliament in blaming the trekkers and attributing to them actions they did not perform. In his words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe attack was made in the first instance by the strike marchers, and the city police were called upon to defend themselves. Subsequently the mounted police joined for the purpose of maintaining order. Shots were fired by the strikers and the fire was replied to by shots from the city police.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 201).<\/p>\n<p>Notably the strikers were not marching. Most were at the exhibition grounds. The police attacked a standing rally of mostly townspeople. Neither did trekkers or any civilians fire weapons nor even have guns on them.<\/p>\n<p>Bennett continued his Red Scare mania. He described the organized unemployed efforts as \u201cnot a mere uprising against law and order but a definite revolutionary effort on the part of a group of men to usurp authority and destroy government\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 202). Bizzarely he claimed the opposition parties and local politicians in British Columbia were in on it.<\/p>\n<p>Much to the dismay of the federal government the provincial government in Saskatchewan launched a commission of inquiry into the causes of the riot and related issues of constitutionality. The Regina Riot Inquiry Commission (RRIC) clearly laid out the extent and intensity of state violence based on witness testimony.<\/p>\n<p>The Regina Riot was without question a police riot. It was initiated entirely by the vicious, and reckless, actions of police at all levels. According to even the state-centric RRIC report:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c[T]he presence of the three troops of police in the vicinity, one of which was advancing towards the crowd, necessarily created some alarm among the people gathered on the Square and lent colour to the belief, which no doubt some of them entertained, that the police had come upon the Square for the purpose of breaking up a peaceable and orderly meeting.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 194)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Witness after witness would later describe the violence of police. The RRIC report documents some of this:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA great deal of evidence was given as to the methods used by the City Police in dispersing the crowd. One witness described it as \u201cswinging their batons and knocking down any persons they could get hold of,\u201d another says, \u201cThey struck wherever the batons wanted to fall.\u201d Another says, \u201cI saw them hitting people with their clubs.\u201d At least ten witnesses have given evidence upon this subject and the above quotations are indications of the general trend of their testimony with respect to it.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 194)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Specific accounts were harrowing. And there were many of them. The report describes many of these if only in brief:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSuch, for instance, is the case of three mounties pounding a man on the ground; three mounties and a city policeman beating one striker, one policeman clubbing an unconscious man near the General Theatre; four city policemen beating one striker; city police marching west on 11<sup>th<\/sup> Avenue shooting as they went, assault of one Belabek on July 2<sup>nd<\/sup> by Sergeant Logan.\u201d (quoted in Brown 1987, 195)<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly the RRIC concluded that reports of police violence were un-Canadian and thus, despite what eyewitnesses actually saw happen, impossible.<\/p>\n<p>The Regina Riot Inquiry Commission also concluded that a compromise agreement could have been reached if the government had allowed its local officials some leeway in negotiating. Prior to the arrests of leaders the RCMP offered no communication with the provincial government about their plans. Tellingly since the RCMP was the provincial force. It is also notable given that RCMP officials knew that the provincial government was meeting with trekkers.<\/p>\n<p>Charges against the more than 100 arrested by police included Section 98, rioting, and assault. Most would be released with charges dropped soon thereafter. Only eight were ever convicted, of minor offences. All of those charged under Section 98 had those charges withdrawn before any trial. The legal outcomes signalled significant vindication for the trekkers and supporters, even in the skewed terms of the law and criminal justice. The only criminal organizations and criminal events of July 1 were those of the state, particularly police, alone.<\/p>\n<p>Across the country blame for the bloodshed in Regina was placed squarely at the feet of Prime Minister Bennett, who was now openly accused of preparing and provoking the riot in a desperately vain attempt to save his own electoral hide. Calls for the abolition of the camps grew louder with opposition parties and even some Conservatives calling for straight up work and wages programs. Mass protest events in support of the trekkers and against the government were held in cities across the country. Branches of the Citizens\u2019 Defence Committee were established in numerous locales. They organized meetings, circulated information, raised money, and petitioned governments (Brown 1987, 203).<\/p>\n<p>The national federal election of October 14, 1935 was held in the shadow of the Regina Riot, the Trek, and the continuing crisis of unemployment. The election would see the ruling Bennett Conservative government routed, dropped from 134 seats to 39. This was the lowest total for the party of confederation since confederation. They amassed only 30 percent of the popular vote nationwide. Their destruction was particularly prominent in Western Canada, holding only one seat in each of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.<\/p>\n<p>The new Liberal government began shutting down the relief camp system in March of 1936 with the last camp closed on July 2 of that year. That same year Section 98 of the Criminal Code was rescinded (Brown 1987, 204).<\/p>\n<p>The struggles of the unemployed did not end, of course. Neither did unemployment with the new government also ill-suited and unprepared to resolve the capitalist crisis. Notably the organized unemployed had helped to effects a shift in political outlook across the land. Their work helped move public opinion away from support for political repression in 1931 as seen in the attack on Bienfait miners, and to a position opposed to such reaction and repression by 1934. That was an outcome of direct action organizing and open, ethical, communication.<\/p>\n<p>Brown notes that in 1937 when International brigades in Canada were formed to fight against fascism in Spain the largest constituency of volunteers to the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion came from vets of the relief camps and On to Ottawa (1987, 206).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>The struggles of the organized unemployed contributed to the growth of working class militance throughout the 1930s. They also contributed to the forces that pushed states to develop social welfare policies in the postwar period, not from benevolence but out of a concern to dissipate social upheaval and defuse discontent that might otherwise topple the existing social structure.<\/p>\n<p>Notably these struggles did not take conventional, approved forms such as electoralism, lobbying, or symbolic appeal (street protest). Rather the approaches of the organized unemployed pursued direct action, militant organization, and extra-parliamentary mobilization. The organized unemployed deployed disruptive rather than conciliatory tactics, though they were strategically attuned enough to make reasonable shifts in their approach. Rather than rely on appeals to authorities they sought to prevent harms from occurring by making it difficult for the state to pursue its aims.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDirect action gets the goods\u201d was a theme of these struggles and battles were waged in relief camps, workplaces, public squares, and government offices against bosses, politicians, and, especially perhaps, police. Notably, unlike the present period, as the battle in Regina shows, the organized unemployed and their direct action tactics were largely understood by the public and enjoyed widespread public support. Their struggles were understood as struggles for all working class people and the stakes had implications for all non-elites.<\/p>\n<p>These are lessons for organizers and movements today. This is particularly so as neoliberal governments advance increasingly repressive measures and escalate police violence in social war. Clearly such governments are not, will not, and have not been swayed by appeals to justice or right or honor. Movements must change the conditions in which such governments operate and must be prepared to defend themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Brown, Lorne. 1987. <em>When Freedom Was Lost<\/em>.

RCMP Kill Man, Tuesday, June 14, 2016","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/06\/15\/nanaimo-rcmp-kill-man-tuesday-june-14-2016\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-3M","content":"<p>RCMP officers shot and killed a man Tuesday morning, June 14, 2016 in Nanaimo, British Columbia. Officers reportedly responded at 10:20 AM to a report of a man carrying a knife at the parking lot of a Dairy Queen at Norwell Drive and Highway 19A.<\/p>\n<p>Two Nanaimo RCMP members initially arrived at the scene locating the man they believed to be the suspect along nearby Country Club Drive. The man was engaged by officers and during the encounter multiple shots were fired with the man being struck fatally. The victim was taken by ambulance to hospital where he died of injuries inflicted by the officers.<\/p>\n<p>The shooting was reported by neighbors as occurring around 10:40 AM when neighbors near St. Andrew\u2019s Presbyterian Church at the corner of Wassell Way and Departure Bay Road first heard what they believed to be gunshots.<\/p>\n<p>Neighbors reported hearing two shots distinctly. A neighbor near the scene of the shooting related: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty scary, I\u2019d never heard anything like that.\u201d According to another neighbor: \u201cI saw an ambulance here, firetrucks, like, I thought maybe it was some kind of movie set going on at first and then I realized that was real life\u201d (quoted in Yu 2016). Reported Sonjia Grandahl, a nearby resident: \u201cI just heard some bang, bang and I knew it didn\u2019t sound right\u201d (quoted in Yu 2016). Rob Waine, a member of nearby St. Andrew\u2019s Presbyterian Church, heard the gunshots while at a meeting inside the church. In his account: \u201cI heard thunder, maybe around 10:30 [AM] and then maybe five or 10 minutes later I hear popping sounds, maybe a couple, that\u2019s about all\u201d (quoted in Yu 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the unit that investigates cases of police violence against civilians in British Columbia, reported that it had been notified about an officer involved shooting in Nanaimo at around noon. This raises some questions about the timeline of police notification to the IIO about the shooting and about the integrity of the crime scene in the period before IIO were notified and able to reach the scene.

secrecy that surrounds information about officers involved in the deaths of civilians, and the fact that officers who kill people are not readily named in the Canadian context, extends to information about the circumstances of police killings of civilians.<\/p>\n<p>Details about police killings of civilians typically only emerge in cases in which charges are brought and which end up in court, since court proceedings are public in Canada, or in certain cases that are reviewed by provincial oversight bodies, where they exist, or in coroners\u2019 inquiries. In cases in which other police forces investigate their fellow police information is not forthcoming. Even in cases that are reviewed by oversight agencies or coroners\u2019 inquiries details can be obscure or conflicting. Yet having some access to witness accounts or evidence and cross examination from lawyers of victims\u2019 families can provide some of the only opportunities for the public to have any insights into the horrible situations faced by victims in their final moments or in events that would lead to their deaths subsequently.<\/p>\n<p>The transcripts of responses to investigators offer some too little seen insights into police encounters with people experiencing mental health crises and show, in a startling and awful way, how quickly police can escalate situations and how single minded (and unforgiving) they are in seeking compliance from people who are clearly distraught, even confused.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Troubling Encounters: The Police Killing of Rhett Mutch<\/p>\n<p>Details released at the conclusion of an Independent Investigations Office (IIO) investigation into the shooting and killing of 20-year-old Rhett Mutch by a Vitoria Police Department officer show the deeply disturbing actions undertaken by police in a situation in which a young man experiencing mental health issues is confronted by officers set on achieving compliance. The following accounts are from that IIO report as reported in Petrescu (2016).<\/p>\n<p>Rhett Mutch was shot and killed by police on the morning of November 1, 2014, in his mother\u2019s home. She had called 911 at 10:51 AM after her son had broken into her home. The two had been texting for some time before the son entered his mother\u2019s house. At the time he was under a court order not to contact her or visit her house. Marney Mutch informed the 911 dispatcher of this. In the kitchen Rhett Mutch took a steak knife with a serrated edge and held it to his stomach (Petrescu 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Lowering the knife Rhett Mutch moved into the living room and sat down on a couch. The 911 dispatcher informed Marney Mutch that police had arrived and told her to leave the house. She refused to leave her son and informed that operator that he was now pointing the knife at the floor and she believed that her son would not harm her (Petrescu 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Within four minutes of the initial call to 911 two Victoria police officers arrived at Marney Mutch\u2019s house. Others were dispatched and on their way. The situation was described by dispatcher to officers as involving a man with a knife to his throat. A supervisor reportedly suggested the officers should \u201ctry and probe, use cover, initiate dialogue\u201d (Petrescu 2016). It seems that the officer did not take this approach in engaging Rhett Mutch.<\/p>\n<p>When Marney Mutch opened the door to meet police she was startled to see the officers approaching her front door with a large gun. She asked: \u201cWhoa. What is that for?\u201d (quoted in Petrescu 2016). The ensuing conversation unfolded as follows according to the investigation report.<\/p>\n<p>The officer upon entering responded: \u201cHe\u2019s armed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mutch clarified: \u201cHe\u2019s got a kitchen knife and he\u2019s not going to hurt anybody with it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The officer asserted their need to protect her and informed her that they had a beanbag gun.<\/p>\n<p>Mutch expressed that she did not fear her son: \u201cHe\u2019s not going to hurt me. He\u2019s not going to hurt anybody.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of the gun wielded by police Marney Mutch further explained to investigators: \u201cSo like, I wanted him to go away with it. He didn\u2019t. It was frightening. It was only going to scare the hell out of him \u2026 He had tears in his eyes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The officer insisted that she not stay in the house. Two more officers entered the house as Marney Mutch exited. She noticed one of the officers carrying a weapon that she described as looking like a bazooka. She again expressed her concerns: \u201cThis is really overkill.\u201d Instead of taking her advice or consulting her further Marney Mutch was made to sit inside a police car away from her son.<\/p>\n<p>There was a sense that the number of officers in his immediate space frightened or agitated Mutch. Officers suggested a change in his demeanor at their presence. A neighbor is recorded in the report saying he heard police repeatedly shouting at the young man and this could be heard from outside the house.<\/p>\n<p>For their part the officers involved told investigators that they were not sure if anyone else was in the house at the time of the encounter. They suggested this ratcheted up their sense of urgency and concern that someone else could be harmed. The presence or not of others, however, could have been determined by asking Marney Mutch. In any event, the IIO noted that this was a serious communication failure by the officers involved.<\/p>\n<p>At 11:02 AM an officer inside the house with a beanbag gun fired at Mutch hitting him in the thigh but apparently not knocking him down (Petrescu 2016). Officers stated that they felt confined with too little room to move quickly or to retreat. This was another serious failing of the police response. Another officer fired hitting Mutch in the neck causing the victim to bleed severely. Paramedics would arrive five minutes later but there were no signs of life and Rhett Mutch was pronounced dead at 11:29 AM.<\/p>\n<p>The IIO cleared the police officer who killed Mutch. Use of force was declared to be justified, the typical ruling from oversight bodies in Canada. In its statement the office concluded:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no evidence to support that the involved officers had any malice against, or motivation to do harm to, the affected person or use any force against him other than what was reasonably necessary to take him into lawful custody\u201d (quoted in Petrescu 2016)<\/p>\n<p>The IIO also concluded that the Victoria Police Department was not criminally negligent in their fateful decision to confront Rhett Mutch rather than withdrawing from the house to a safer barricade position from which they, or a mental healthcare person, could negotiate.<\/p>\n<p>Once again concerns were raised about the timeframe of the IIO investigation. It took a rather tardy 19 months to complete, an issue that IIO critics note has become standard for the unit.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Serious Questions<\/p>\n<p>IIO Chair Marten Youseff reported that the events surrounding the killing of Rhett Mutch raised serious questions for officers regarding the actions of the Victoria Police Department. According to the report: \u201cUnfortunately, significant communication failures led to different perspectives amongst different officers as to the need to immediately confront the affected person\u201d (quoted in Petrescu 2016). Yet there is no explanation for the confusion on this given that Marney Mutch had spoken of the lack of immediate (or looming) threat both to the 911 dispatcher and to the officers at the scene. And police knew that she was inside a police vehicle and thus facing no threat at all at the time police entered the house.<\/p>\n<p>The IIO report concludes: \u201cGiven the totality of the circumstances, there are significant questions that need to be asked as to why the officers were inside the residence at all, at the moment the shots were fired\u201d (quoted in Lupick 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Of particular concern for investigators was the fact that the officers involved did not know who was in the house when they entered. This despite the obvious, acknowledged, presence of the mother and the opportunity to speak with her (as at least one officer did). The officer who shot Mutch claimed that he would have proceeded differently, setting up an armed barricade and not entering the house, if he had been aware that no one else was inside or that Mutch was suicidal (Petrescu 2016). The number of officers in a tight space was said to limit their options. Neither pepper spray nor baton were deemed viable in that context.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the findings of the investigation and the description of what happened by Marney Mutch the Victoria Police Department continued to portray officers as trying to de-escalate the situation. In a statement released following the IIO report, Victoria police chief Del Manak stated:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn addition to the grief and sorrow this has caused the family, this incident has had a profound effect on the officers who were involved. Despite their training, experience, the action plan they developed for this dynamic situation, and their attempts to de-escalate the situation, this incident ended in tragedy.\u201d (quoted in Petrescu 2016)<\/p>\n<p>Yet this was a tragedy that need not have occurred.<\/p>\n<p>Victoria police were presented with the IIO report and insisted they will work with the Office of the Police Complaint Commissioner to examine departmental protocols. In a statement they claim: \u201cwe remain committed to continual assessment of our practices. This is especially important given the steadily increasing number of calls from the public requesting that our officers attend to people experiencing some form of crisis\u201d (quoted in Petrescu 2016). Yet in case after case in the Canadian context, regardless of jurisdiction police are responding to people experiencing crisis with a \u201ccomply or die\u201d focus, aggression, violence, and ultimately lethal force.<\/p>\n<p>And when police act in these encounters they tend to act aggressively and quickly with no sense of attempts at de-escalation or communication. According to the IIO report, only between five and six minutes passed between the time at which Victoria police officers made contact with Mutch and the discharge of a firearm. As Lupick notes, that is significantly longer than is often the case in other police shootings in British Columbia. Lupick notes that there is a pattern in fatal encounters involving police and civilians in the province. It is, in fact, common for police to have fired their weapons within the first few minutes of contact with someone experiencing mental health issues or personal crisis, often discharging weapons within the first 60 seconds of contact (Lupick 2016). Clearly this shows that virtually no efforts are made a de-escalation or discussion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>Following the release of the IIO investigation report Marney Mutch told reporters that in her view it was the actions of police and their hard response that led to an intensification of her son\u2019s behavior. In particular she noted the presence of large, ominous looking, weapons, the number of officers confronting her son, five, and the fact that they cornered her son in a single room. In her view: \u201cThey created the situation that led to my son being shot\u201d (quoted in Petrescu 2016).<\/p>\n<p>She believes that her son Rhett did not want to die and would not have killed himself and she is confident that she was never in danger from her son. In her words: \u201cThere was nothing aggressive about him\u201d (quoted in Petrescu 2016). In the view of Marney Mutch, and indeed of many commentators and critics, it is the wrong approach to aggressively confront someone, particularly with weapons, experiencing a mental health crisis (Petrescu 2016). She has added her voice to the call from others for improved training for police in dealing with people experiencing mental health emergencies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Lupick, Travis. 2016. \u201cInvestigators Clear B.C.

Police","URL":"https:\/\/killercopscanada.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/15\/no-oversight-no-accountability-problems-of-supposedly-independent-investigations-of-police\/","short_URL":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6uq3K-3C","content":"<p>Too often people in hopes for reform of policing, or for increased accountability of police, on the creation of supposedly independent investigation or oversight agencies. These institutions are often held out as some sort of panacea for problems of police brutality and crime. To be sure such agencies can represent an improvement over the dubious situation that exists in many provinces in Canada in which police violence against civilians, including killings of civilians, is only \u201cinvestigated\u201d by their colleagues in other forces, often within the same province or jurisdiction. At the same time the evidence over years of operation of independent investigation units, in provinces including Ontario, Alberta, and Manitoba, shows that such units are never truly independent from police agencies and furthermore they are hampered by a range of issues from underfunding and lack of resources, to interference, obstruction, harassment and hostility from police, and few if any means to address uncooperative and non-compliant behavior among officers. Such institutions are also set upon by police associations and law and order police-friendly politicians alike.<\/p>\n<p>The situations of non-autonomy, interference and intimidation, and lack of mechanisms for accountability or compliance with regard to supposedly independent investigations of police suggest that such agencies rather than offering real accountability for policing provide more of a cover for police operations, providing the public a false sense of integrity, oversight, or justice (a final line of community quality control). Indeed it is a misnomer to speak of these agencies as oversight agencies precisely because they have no authority over police and do nothing about day to day operations, governance, or practices of policing. In the end the independent investigations units can only make recommendations to the Crown, with decisions to proceed with charges rarely coming from police friendly and collaborative prosecutors concerned with career interests and working relationships.<\/p>\n<p>In practice investigations units are plagued by lack of resources, reliance on police and police institutions for training, and absence of mechanisms to ensure cooperation or compliance from police. In many cases investigations take too long and result in little more than a reproduction of police excuses.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The IIO in BC<\/p>\n<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia was, like other such units, received by much public anticipation and hopefulness. It would replace an unacceptable situation in the province in which police investigated police for police acts that resulted in harm to civilians. Since its founding in 2012, however, it has reproduced many of the problems experienced by other independent investigation units.<\/p>\n<p>The office itself had its origins in the brutal killing by police of Robert Dziekanski, a traveler from Poland who was assaulted by several RCMP officers, tasered multiple times, and killed in the Vancouver International Airport (YVR). In the days immediately following the killing the RCMP made a number of public statements in which they blatantly lied about the circumstances of the killing, distorting what happened and pursuing a character assassination of the victim who they falsely described as drunk and aggressive (he was neither). The RCMP manipulation of the case would be undone when a witness brought forward a video recording of the encounter with police showing the RCMP story to be a fabrication (Dziekanski was retreating and compliant when police inexplicably tasered him repeatedly and jumped him). This video by Paul Pritchard, would become perhaps the most famous and significant piece of civilian journalism involving police violence in Canadian history. A public inquiry into the RCMP killing of Robert Dziekanski, and further evidence of officer collusion and lying, would lead to the creation of the IIO (lead officer Monty Robinson and one other officer involved in the killing, Kwesi Millington, would be found guilty of perjury).<\/p>\n<p>Yet several years into its operations the IIO has become another symbol of disgraceful policing related practices in the province. It has been plagued by personal turnover, complaints by workers against administrators, and concerns about connections with the Justice Institute of British Columbia, which trains IIO members but is simultaneously the police training academy for officers in the province and which employs active officers as instructors.<\/p>\n<p>Among the issues that have received the most public attention and criticism has been the significant delay in completing investigations. The IIO is routinely taking up to 18 months to complete its investigations into police involved deaths and injuries of civilians, with concerns that these are moving toward two year completion times.<\/p>\n<p>These concerns were recently heightened when the IIO reported that the investigation into a police killing of a mother and son, Shirley Williams, 77, and Jovan Williams, 39, in the small town of Granisle on April 21, 2016, will again take approximately 18 months.<\/p>\n<p>Pivot Legal Society, a Vancouver-based civil rights law group, has raised concerns about IIO practice and the great length of delays in investigation reporting. Pivot is currently awaiting the conclusion of several IIO investigations, including the killing of Tony Du in 2014, who was shot and killed by the Vancouver Police Department. That case is now getting close to 18 months without a report. Other outstanding cases which are now coming near 18 months with no IIO report are those involving the police shootings of Peter de Groot in Slocan, BC and Naverone Woods, who was killed in Surrey, BC. According to Pivot lawyer Douglas King:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a limitation period of two years to start an action in most cases now, and people who are directly involved in these incidents, and families who have been affected, that\u2019s often the deadline where they have to decide if they\u2019re going to take action against a police department. 18 months is truly unacceptable, two years would be a bit of a disaster, to be perfectly honest. It would have severe impacts on the rest of the legal system.\u201d (quoted in Britten 2016)<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the impacts on the system and the issue of killer cops being active on their force, there is also the issue of addressing family needs and concerns. As King suggests: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely brutal, especially for the families of people killed by police, and for the officers themselves, to have to wait that long,\u201d (quoted in Britten 2016).<\/p>\n<p>The IIO has little to offer in the way of an adequate explanation for the numerous roubles plaguing the agency. Incredibly they have pointed to the sheer number of police involved killings of civilians in the province over the last few years. But that is what they are supposed to be addressing. According to IIO spokesperson Marten Youseff:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn officer-involved fatality is equivalent to a homicide in the level of rigour that&#8217;s required. We rely on third-party reports. We don\u2019t have our own forensic laboratory \u2026 and sometimes those reports take an exceeding amount of time. We\u2019re definitely not proud of our timeliness, and we&#8217;re doing everything we can to expedite this process.\u201d (quoted in Britten 2016)<\/p>\n<p>Pivot Legal Society is having a hard time accepting this. Douglas King believes that some of the delays in the IIO are related to internal problems within the institution itself. In his opinion: \u201cIf the only thing holding up these investigations is a third-party report, then we really need to start talking to the provincial government about how that can be fixed.\u00a0 If it&#8217;s a problem with internal issues with the IIO, then certainly the public has an expectation that the IIO should fix those&#8221; (quoted in Britten 2016).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>Yet in numerous other cases of supposed police oversight agencies, including ones with longer histories and opportunities for correction than the IIO such as the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) in Ontario, the evidence shows that these problems are endemic to police oversight and cannot simply be reformed. They certainly cannot be addressed by training that includes active officers and\/or institutions that maintain official training relations with officers. They also cannot be reformed through an addition of resources, including more investigators. Official reports, such as the Ombudsperson\u2019s report in Ontario have noted the persistence by police forces of harassment, obstruction, uncooperative behavior, disruption and interference, and outright insolence and contempt shown by officers toward investigators and the investigations process. Until police are subject to consequences and punishment, including criminal consequences, for failing to comply with investigations or to follow processes without obstruction there will be no fulsome police oversight, or investigation that anyone can have any confidence in. Beyond this it is virtually impossible to carry out any truly independent, autonomous oversight of or investigation into police when they control their own crime scenes.<\/p>\n<p>More than this, of course, is the lager issue of policing and the role of police within class stratified societies. The institution of policing is inherently political and police forces exert tremendous political pressure on governments and \u201cregulators\u201d at all levels. All of this occurs in a context in which police have been designed and developed as instruments of social war and the defense of status quo relations (which by definition will be enforced through often lethal violence). The only way to ensure public confidence and safety would be a dismantling of policing and rearrangement of social resources to support broader social services (mental health supports, community resources, social hosing, safe use sites, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading<\/p>\n<p>Britten, Liam. 2016. \u201cIIO Investigations Taking Too Long at 18 Months, Says Critic.\u201d <em>CBC News<\/em>.
