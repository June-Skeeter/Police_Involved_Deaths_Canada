<p>The notion of “suicide by cop” is a phony construct devised as a cynical ruse to excuse killer cops and get them off the hook when they kill civilians. The problems with this notion have been detailed and analyzed repeatedly in this project. Applied after the fact and in a range of instances, including those in which the cop killed someone who posed no threat to police or the public, the excuse covers up killings which are in no way suicides. If a police officer chooses to shoot someone who is isolated from the public and poses no threat to anyone, that is not suicide. If the cop has a choice not to kill, that killing is not a suicide. Saying it is denies the dignity of the victim who has not chosen to  end their own life. It has been consciously ended for them. Without consent. Suicide by cop is in these cases purely propagandistic.</p>
<p>Yet killer cops, their departments, and police associations routinely trot this piece of copaganda out in diverse circumstances. Such is the case of Toronto Constable James Focillo who shot 18-year-old Sammy Yatim multiple times while the youth was all alone and readily contained on an inoperative and empty streetcar. Forcillo was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to six years in prison for the 2013 killing of Yatim. Forcillo is now appealing his conviction on the basis that testimony arguing for “suicide by cop” in Yatim’s case was excluded from the trial. The testimony was provided from cop “criminologist” Rick Parent of Simon Fraser University who has built a tidy side career on justifying “suicide by cop” claims by his colleagues who kill.</p>
<p>The suicide by cop claim is ludicrous in this case. First, Yatim was alone and contained and posed no threat to the public or police. Secondly, Forcillo fired two distinct volleys of multiple shots at the youth, pausing before shooting the second volley even after the young man had fallen dead from the first round of shots. Clearly not a suicide. Forcillo had multiple opportunities not to shoot and to stop shooting. There is no way to construe that as a suicide on Yatim’s part.</p>
<p>Forcillo, who is currently on bail pending the appeal, is asking for a not guilty verdict or a new trial. Forcillo is asking the appeal court, which is set to hear his case this fall, to substitute a not-guilty verdict or order a new trial. The killer cop is also seeking a declaration that his mandatory minimum sentence for attempted murder is unconstitutional, and seeks a suspended sentence. Absent these outcomes he wants his sentence reduced to the minimum of five years.</p>

As the officer struggled to make the arrest, Lance Cutarm and his brothers got out and ""fanned out"" around the officer, who was on his own. The officer fatally shot Lance Cutarm and wounded one of his brothers. The family says the officer's reponse to ""perceived danger"" was racial. An investigative report found no evidence the officer's actions were racially motivated.
<p>The family of Lance Cutarm (30), member of the Ermineskin Cree Nation, is suing the RCMP officer who killed him during a 2013 traffic stop near Pigeon Lake, Alberta.</p>
<p>On August 3, a vehicle driven by Lawrence Cutarm and his three sons, including Lance Cutarm, was pulled over by RCMP officer Corporal Kevin Krebs. The lawsuit claims that Corporal Krebs became violent with Lawrence Cutarm outside the vehicle, without warning striking him on the head and handcuffing his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>Lance Cutarm and his two brothers, all of whom were outside the vehicle, asked Krebs to stop using force against their father. The lawsuit claims the three were running away from Krebs when he opened fire, fatally shooting Lance in the chest and striking his older brother, Laron Cutarm, twice in the torso.</p>
<p>The claim states that the brothers “were not acting in a threatening manner to Krebs or to anyone, and this use of deadly force was unnecessary, excessive and unlawful.” The suit also claims: “The RCMP members’ conduct constitutes an arbitrary and malicious punishment and a malicious exercise of their authority.”</p>
<p>While criminal charges were initially laid against Lawrence and Laron Cutarm they were withdrawn by a prosecutor in May 2014.</p>
<p>In January, Alberta’s police watchdog, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) reported that this lethal interaction with the RCMP started because Krebs pulled the Cutarms’ truck over after a passenger gave him the middle finger as they drove by him.</p>

<p>The 2017 coroner’s inquest into the police killing of Michael MacIsaac has already heard dubious testimony from the officer who shot him, Brian Taylor. As the inquest continues, on July 26, another police officer, Durham Regional Police Constable Mark Brown, has added to the questionable police testimony by suggesting that the dying victim played a part in his own death by actively resisting help.  Brown was the first to respond to a 911 call involving Michael MacIsaac on that morning on December 2, 2013. MacIsaac was shot by Taylor while he was experiencing effects of an epileptic seizure and was naked in the street near his home.</p>
<p>In Brown&#8217;s own testimony: “I remember him saying stuff, but I couldn’t understand what he was saying. The only thing I understood when performing first aid, was MacIsaac said ‘pain’ (quoted in McLaughlin 2017). That seems clear enough. But the cop wants the jury to believe the dying man did not want the pain to stop.</p>
<p>The MacIsaac family lawyer, Roy Wellington questioned Constable Brown about his claim that MacIsaac resisted help. Asked Wellington: “Does it strike you as odd that someone would not want to be touched after being shot by the same people” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017)? Brown could not offer such empathetic insight.</p>
<p>Family members in attendance at the inquest were dumbfounded at the officer’s testimony. Said Brian MacIsaac’s sister, Joanne:  “I can’t imagine what was going through Michael’s head, and know the pain must have been horrible. But to tell him after the fact, we are here to help you? It’s ridiculous, ridiculous to me. Why didn&#8217;t you help him before?” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017).  Joanne MacIsaac suggested that the officer’s testimony was not close to believable. She continued in frustration:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“His narrative of what happened has got to be, in my opinion, fabricated. To say Michael was actively resisting when he’s naked, cold on the ground and you&#8217;re pushing in on his abdomen after he has been shot, to use the phrase ‘he’s actively resisting,’ my god what is the matter with these people?” (quoted in McLaughlin 2017)</p>

<p>Under cross examination by Anita Szigeti, a lawyer with Toronto’s Empowerment Council for people with mental health issues, Constable Brown, an officer with 14 years of experience on the force had undertaken only one week of mental health training ever and that had occurred a decade before the killing of Michael MacIsaac. Brown had to admit on the stand that his training was not adequate.</p>

<p>Killer cop Brian Taylor provided two days of questionable, even outright unbelievable, testimony during the coroner’s inquest into his 2013 killing of 47-year-old Michael MacIsaac. As witnesses and 911 call evidence contradicted much of his depiction of events, Constable Taylor turned to the bogus and obnoxious “excited delirium” excuse to blame the victim. Notably the inquest testimony was the first time he raised this baseless suggestion, a last refuge of killer cops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contradicted Testimony</p>
<p>Taylor claims he feared for his life when seeing MacIsaac, yet he was safely inside his police vehicle and decided to exit only after seeing the man he was supposedly threatened by near him. Taylor claimed in his testimony that he heard MacIsaac say “Come on, come on,” and claims that he issued the police challenge, “Police. Don’t move,” to MacIsaac and remembers hearing it.</p>
<p>Taykor testified at length:</p>
<p>“Somebody said ‘Drop it, get down on the ground.’ I thought that if I have to take a shot, don’t miss. There are a lot of people around. Then he moved off the curb. I fired the first round. I didn’t hear the gun go off. I felt it . . . . I didn’t know if I had hit him, because there was no effect. And he continued to move and I fired a second round and I know that one struck him.” (quoted in Gallant 2017a)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roy Wellington, the MacIsaac family’s lawyer, used cross-examination to note that most of Constable Taylor’s claims about what was said are not captured on a 911 call made by Ron Nino the witness who stopped the arriving Taylor and told him MacIsaac was in the area. On that call a voice is heard telling Nino “get back, get back” (Gallant 2017a). Only seconds later shots are fired. No one is heard at any point either issuing commands to MacIsaac or saying “Come on, come on.” Nino said that Taylor fired almost immediately. The MacIsaac family had that call analyzed by a forensic scientist to see if there were cuts or absences. That report concluded that “there are no definite signs of alterations or breaks found on this recording” (quoted in Gallant 2017b).</p>
<p>Queried Wellington: “I’m having a hard time understanding how we can hear someone further away from Mr. Nino, but we don’t actually hear you issuing any commands at all” (quoted in Gallant 2017a).</p>
<p>Wellington continued: ““Regardless of who shouted commands, there wasn’t much of an opportunity for Mr. MacIsaac to respond. Would you agree with that?” (quoted in Gallant 2017a).</p>
<p>Constable Taylor offered the rather desperate response that perhaps the cell phone malfunctioned. This despite the forensic tests. Taylor’s lawyer, Bill MacKenzie tried to suggest that 911 called Nino back and thus interfered with the call, which, frankly, makes no sense.</p>
<p>Questions are also being asked why Taylor shot MacIsaac twice and how he could not see if the first shot hit the man, since he was naked and there were no clothes to obscure a bullet strike and wound. Incredibly, Taylor believed the victim was “still a threat” even after he saw black-red blood streaming out of the stricken man’s abdomen. Two other officers took time to handcuff the dying man rather than giving him any medical attention.</p>

<p>Taylor, desperately and pathetically, tried to introduce the phony notion of “excited delirium” to describe MacIsaac and justify the killing. Excited delirium is a bogus claim produced by police and police associations after the fact when they kill someone. Incredibly Taylor suggested this was his first thought when hearing over police that the person he was seeking might be suffering mental health issues. The family suggests that MacIsaac was in crisis as a result of an epileptic seizure but did not have mental health issues.</p>
<p>Anita Szigeti, a lawyer for the Empowerment Council, an advocacy group for people with lived experiences of mental health and addiction issues noted that organizations including the World Health Organization and American Medical Association do not recognize it as an actual condition (Gallant 2017b). Szigeti rightly pointed out that the only ones who maintain that it is a condition are the “maker of Tasers” and law enforcement members (Gallant 2017b). We might add pro-police criminologists or copagandists.</p>
<p>Szigeti posed this to Constable Taylor. In her words: “But, do you know ‘excited delirium’ is extremely controversial, over whether it’s even a condition at all?” (quoted in Gallant 2017b). Taylor answered simply, “Yes.”</p>
<p>Szigeti said that she was puzzled because Taylor promoted the notion of excited delirium at the inquest but the term does not appear anywhere in his notes on the shooting. Neither does it appear in his interviews with the Special Investigations Unit or the Office of the Independent Police Review Director (Gallant 2017b).</p>
<p>This led Szigeti to conclude: “I’m going to suggest to you that you never thought about ‘excited delirium’ at all until long after the events when you shot Mr. MacIsaac” (quoted in Gallant 2017b). This at base the nature of this phony claim. It is an after the fact justification for killer cops desperate for an answer when all reasonable explanations are absent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Joanne MacIsaac, Michael MacIsaac’s sister, is also asking if the SIU bothered to listen to the Nino 911 call in its investigation into the killing which resulted in a decision not to bring criminal charges against Constable Taylor.</p>
<p>Taylor ended his testimony, on its second day, with the admission, in response to a question from a juror: “With hindsight being 20/20, yes, there probably could have been a better way to resolve it” (quoted in Gallant 2017b).</p>

<p>Constable Brian Taylor (46), the Durham police officer who shot and killed Michael MacIsaac took the stand July 20, 2017 for his first day of testimony at the coroner’s inquest into the killing. Taylor shot and killed MacIsaac, who was clearly in distress, on December 2, 2013 in Ajax, Ontario. The officer’s testimony raised many serious questions about his actions and aspects of his account have been contradicted by witnesses who have already testified.</p>
<p>Constable Taylor shot Michael MacIsaac within seconds of encountering the distressed man who was in the street naked. Taylor claims that MacIsaac came at him with a table leg and that he feared for his life. Yet witnesses have testified that MacIsaac was not holding any table leg at the time he was shot. A patio table leg allegedly retrieved at the scene was lightweight and hollow.  Taylor testified that it was obvious to him that MacIsaac was in distress as soon as he saw the man. Yet he did nothing to de-escalate the situation. This despite the fact that two other police officers were already at the scene. No warning was issued to MacIsaac by any officer before the shooting.</p>
<p>Serious questions remain about why Constable Taylor fired a second shot at the already stricken man. It is also uncertain why Taylor exited his police car to confront the man if he feared for his life. He would have been entirely safe against the naked man from within his police vehicle. These issues raise troubling questions about the actions taken by Constable Taylor</p>

<p>Constable Brian Taylor has been identified as the Durham police officer who shot and killed 47-year-old Michael MacIsaac on December 2, 2013 in a residential neighborhood in Ajax, Ontario. Constable Taylor shot Mr. MacIsaac twice within 12 seconds of exiting his police cruiser. The coroner’s inquest in to the killing started in July 2017 and Taylor is scheduled to testify during the week of July 17, likely on July 20. As is the case for most killer cops, Officer Taylor was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in two previous reviews, one by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, and the second by the Office of the Independent Police Review Director.</p>
<p>The MacIsaac family has always maintained that the victim was struggling with an epilepsy-related incident in which he ran into the street naked and engaged with passing drivers. This had followed a  confrontation inside a family house involving MacIsaac, his wife, and her sister.</p>
<p>The inquest and its jury of four men and one woman have already heard from Michael MacIsaac’s sister, Joanne MacIsaac, and his wife, Marianne Madjarian. Marianne Madjarian, testified on July 17, that in her view something was wrong with her husband on the morning of the shooting. She had not witnessed any comparable behavior previously, and was, thus, unsure what she should do. She said that he loved his family very much and had no history of violence. In her testimony, Joanne MacIsaac explained her brother’s history of epileptic seizures and the prolonged states of confusion that followed from them. She related that she had spoken to her brother two days before he was shot and in her view he seemed to be in good spirits.</p>
<p>The family has been insistent that they do not want this inquiry to make a familiar recommendation of increased taser use. This is neither appropriate nor effective for people in health distress. In Joanne MacIsaac’s words:  “In my opinion, the people who are being shot and killed by police are not the people shooting back, they are the vulnerable sector of society. I know additional Taser use comes out in all these inquests. I don’t think that’s the answer” (quoted in Powers 2017). Instead people in distress need to be given more care and time.</p>
<p>As Madjarian said: “He was in a mental health crisis, which is apparent when you’re running around naked on a cold morning. He needed help. He was not a criminal” (quoted in Powers 2017). Regardless, police are killing too many people, for doing little, who pose no real threat to them</p>

Deslauriers shot and killed Lacour after apparently responding to a call about a stolen car. The prosecution argues that Deslauriers shot the teenager rather than have him escape.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly rare for police officers who kill civilians to be subjected to any punishment. Charges are almost never laid and full trials virtually never held. Killer cops are certainly treated to a different, and decidedly favorable response, from the criminal justice system than are civilians who kill. This is in no way surprising. As we have documented repeatedly, the state protects its officers. And there should be no illusions that the state would deliver anything resembling justice in such cases of state (police) violence.</p>

McCaffrey, in a state of distress and wielding two knives, was shocked with a stun gun when he was seen to injure himself. When that failed to stop him, one of the officers shot McCaffrey twice. He was rushed to the hospital where he died of his wounds. An independent investigation found the officer used reasonable force in the incident.
<p>Police in Rothesay, New Brunswick have fought to keep body camera footage of the killing of William David McCaffrey by an officer of the Kennebecasis Regional Police Force from the public. On July 27, 2017, the access to information and privacy commissioner for the province called for release of the tape.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old youth was shot and killed by police in his home on February 28, 2014, while experiencing mental health distress. McCaffrey was shot twice while harming himself. The force was not investigated by a civilian oversight unit but only by another police force, the RCMP. The finding for release of the tape comes after a 15-month battle over access to information by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).</p>
<p>Commissioner Anne Bertrand in deciding the case determined that public interest in police use of force cases supercedes privacy, including for police. This ruling could have something to say about who is able to see police body camera footage in the future. In an interview Bertrand clarified: “In special circumstances, there may be a public interest in the public knowing about what happened, despite there being personal information involved” (quoted in Donkin 2017).</p>
<p>The Kennebecasis Regional Police Force had denied a request from CBC News of information of footage from a police body camera in 2016. They cited privacy concerns.</p>
<p>CBC News appealed the police decision to Bertrand. The news station argued that body-worn camera footage should be treated the same way as any other record showing how police make a decision (2017). According to the CBC News claim: “Having access to those records is necessary to ensure public safety and accountability” (quoted in Donkin 2017).</p>
<p>In her decision, Bertrand invoked a little used public interest section of the Right to Information and Protection of Privacy Act. It says that in cases where there is “a risk of significant harm,” which could include a danger to public safety, that section can override other parts of the law that protect privacy (Donkin 2017).</p>
<p>This would be the first case of release of police body camera footage in the Canadian context, unlike the situation in the United States in which such footage has been released numerous times. As is too often the case in public body decisions involving police conduct, the police force is not required to adhere to Bertrand’s decision and is already pursuing legal advice. Once again the police assume the powers of a law unto themselves.</p>

Mutch charged at them with a knife, and police opened fire. His mother heard over the police radio that her son had been shot in the neck. Mutch bled out at the scene.
<p>This project has documented the bogus nature of “suicide by cop” as a means to excuse police killings of civilians. It is a form of copaganda used as a legitimation tool by so-called oversight agencies (none of which are autonomous and independent from police with powers of compulsion) and state inquests to justify police killings of civilians to an anxious and critical public. The reasons for the bogus nature of this claim are numerous and have been laid out here previously. The claim is only applied after the fact in diverse situations and ignores the fact that unlike in other suicides the victim is killed, not by their own actions, but by the conscious decision of someone who chooses to use lethal force rather choosing not to kill.</p>
<p>Once again this phony “finding” has been used to legitimate the lethal actions of a killer cop. The killing of 20-year-old Victoria youth Rhett Mutch by police constable John Musicco has been declared a suicide by a coroner’s inquest in findings announced May 19, 2017. Incredibly the inquest report offered no reasons for why the jury classified the killing as a suicide. Constable Musicco had already been cleared by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the body that examines cases of police violence against civilians in British Columbia.</p>
<p>Musicco shot Mutch in the neck killing him  on November 1, 2014. At the time he was shot the young man was alone in the basement of his mother’s house and posed no threat to his mother (who was safely outside the house) or to the general public.</p>
<p>The report even noted in detail an exchange between Marney Mutch, the victim’s mother, and police officers in which she told them that her son would not hurt anyone. She also informed them that drawn guns would only frighten her distraught son further. She told the inquest that one of the officers held a gun that looked like “a bazooka.” This is another problem of &#8220;suicide by cop&#8221; excuses. They ignore the role of police actions in changing victim&#8217;s interactions. In her view, as stated in the report: “This is really overkill.” She wanted to stay in the house with her son but officers refused her request.</p>

<p>More than two years ago a Victoria mother’s plea for help for her son ended with police taking the young man’s life. Rhett Mutch was shot and killed inside his mom’s home by Constable John Musicco. Mutch posed no threat to the public. In a 911 call made by Marney Mutch she told the operator that her son would not do anything to physically hurt her. While Musicco was, predictably, cleared of any wrongdoing in killing Rhett Mutch by the provincial investigation unit for British Columbia, a coroner’s inquest is looking into the killing.</p>
<p>Rhett Mutch was killed by Constable Musicco on November 1, 2014. Marney Mutch had called 911 after her son broke into the basement of her home on Dallas Road in Victoria. Several police officers entered the home, killing Mutch within only minutes of their arrival.</p>
<p>The inquest which started May 15, 2017 has focused on misinformation apparently passed from the 911 operator to police. In the 911 call, which was played for the coroner’s jury, Marney Mutch said that her son had a knife, but would not use it to hurt her and further told the operator that he was holding it by his stomach. In the dispatch audio, a police dispatcher is heard saying that Rhett Mutch was holding the knife to his throat.</p>
<p>Victoria Police Sergeant Gregory Holmes,  the supervisor the day of the incident testified to the jury on Monday, May 15 but could not answer why police responded with force if Marney Mutch was not in danger and simply wanted help for her son. It is not clear either why police went after Rhett Mutch who was by then alone in the house, his mother having left safely when police arrived.</p>

<p>The secrecy that surrounds information about officers involved in the deaths of civilians, and the fact that officers who kill people are not readily named in the Canadian context, extends to information about the circumstances of police killings of civilians.</p>
<p>Details about police killings of civilians typically only emerge in cases in which charges are brought and which end up in court, since court proceedings are public in Canada, or in certain cases that are reviewed by provincial oversight bodies, where they exist, or in coroners’ inquiries. In cases in which other police forces investigate their fellow police information is not forthcoming. Even in cases that are reviewed by oversight agencies or coroners’ inquiries details can be obscure or conflicting. Yet having some access to witness accounts or evidence and cross examination from lawyers of victims’ families can provide some of the only opportunities for the public to have any insights into the horrible situations faced by victims in their final moments or in events that would lead to their deaths subsequently.</p>
<p>The transcripts of responses to investigators offer some too little seen insights into police encounters with people experiencing mental health crises and show, in a startling and awful way, how quickly police can escalate situations and how single minded (and unforgiving) they are in seeking compliance from people who are clearly distraught, even confused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubling Encounters: The Police Killing of Rhett Mutch</p>
<p>Details released at the conclusion of an Independent Investigations Office (IIO) investigation into the shooting and killing of 20-year-old Rhett Mutch by a Vitoria Police Department officer show the deeply disturbing actions undertaken by police in a situation in which a young man experiencing mental health issues is confronted by officers set on achieving compliance. The following accounts are from that IIO report as reported in Petrescu (2016).</p>
<p>Rhett Mutch was shot and killed by police on the morning of November 1, 2014, in his mother’s home. She had called 911 at 10:51 AM after her son had broken into her home. The two had been texting for some time before the son entered his mother’s house. At the time he was under a court order not to contact her or visit her house. Marney Mutch informed the 911 dispatcher of this. In the kitchen Rhett Mutch took a steak knife with a serrated edge and held it to his stomach (Petrescu 2016).</p>
<p>Lowering the knife Rhett Mutch moved into the living room and sat down on a couch. The 911 dispatcher informed Marney Mutch that police had arrived and told her to leave the house. She refused to leave her son and informed that operator that he was now pointing the knife at the floor and she believed that her son would not harm her (Petrescu 2016).</p>
<p>Within four minutes of the initial call to 911 two Victoria police officers arrived at Marney Mutch’s house. Others were dispatched and on their way. The situation was described by dispatcher to officers as involving a man with a knife to his throat. A supervisor reportedly suggested the officers should “try and probe, use cover, initiate dialogue” (Petrescu 2016). It seems that the officer did not take this approach in engaging Rhett Mutch.</p>
<p>When Marney Mutch opened the door to meet police she was startled to see the officers approaching her front door with a large gun. She asked: “Whoa. What is that for?” (quoted in Petrescu 2016). The ensuing conversation unfolded as follows according to the investigation report.</p>
<p>The officer upon entering responded: “He’s armed.”</p>
<p>Mutch clarified: “He’s got a kitchen knife and he’s not going to hurt anybody with it.”</p>
<p>The officer asserted their need to protect her and informed her that they had a beanbag gun.</p>
<p>Mutch expressed that she did not fear her son: “He’s not going to hurt me. He’s not going to hurt anybody.”</p>
<p>Speaking of the gun wielded by police Marney Mutch further explained to investigators: “So like, I wanted him to go away with it. He didn’t. It was frightening. It was only going to scare the hell out of him … He had tears in his eyes.”</p>
<p>The officer insisted that she not stay in the house. Two more officers entered the house as Marney Mutch exited. She noticed one of the officers carrying a weapon that she described as looking like a bazooka. She again expressed her concerns: “This is really overkill.” Instead of taking her advice or consulting her further Marney Mutch was made to sit inside a police car away from her son.</p>
<p>There was a sense that the number of officers in his immediate space frightened or agitated Mutch. Officers suggested a change in his demeanor at their presence. A neighbor is recorded in the report saying he heard police repeatedly shouting at the young man and this could be heard from outside the house.</p>
<p>For their part the officers involved told investigators that they were not sure if anyone else was in the house at the time of the encounter. They suggested this ratcheted up their sense of urgency and concern that someone else could be harmed. The presence or not of others, however, could have been determined by asking Marney Mutch. In any event, the IIO noted that this was a serious communication failure by the officers involved.</p>
<p>At 11:02 AM an officer inside the house with a beanbag gun fired at Mutch hitting him in the thigh but apparently not knocking him down (Petrescu 2016). Officers stated that they felt confined with too little room to move quickly or to retreat. This was another serious failing of the police response. Another officer fired hitting Mutch in the neck causing the victim to bleed severely. Paramedics would arrive five minutes later but there were no signs of life and Rhett Mutch was pronounced dead at 11:29 AM.</p>
<p>The IIO cleared the police officer who killed Mutch. Use of force was declared to be justified, the typical ruling from oversight bodies in Canada. In its statement the office concluded:</p>
<p>“There is no evidence to support that the involved officers had any malice against, or motivation to do harm to, the affected person or use any force against him other than what was reasonably necessary to take him into lawful custody” (quoted in Petrescu 2016)</p>
<p>The IIO also concluded that the Victoria Police Department was not criminally negligent in their fateful decision to confront Rhett Mutch rather than withdrawing from the house to a safer barricade position from which they, or a mental healthcare person, could negotiate.</p>
<p>Once again concerns were raised about the timeframe of the IIO investigation. It took a rather tardy 19 months to complete, an issue that IIO critics note has become standard for the unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Serious Questions</p>
<p>IIO Chair Marten Youseff reported that the events surrounding the killing of Rhett Mutch raised serious questions for officers regarding the actions of the Victoria Police Department. According to the report: “Unfortunately, significant communication failures led to different perspectives amongst different officers as to the need to immediately confront the affected person” (quoted in Petrescu 2016). Yet there is no explanation for the confusion on this given that Marney Mutch had spoken of the lack of immediate (or looming) threat both to the 911 dispatcher and to the officers at the scene. And police knew that she was inside a police vehicle and thus facing no threat at all at the time police entered the house.</p>
<p>The IIO report concludes: “Given the totality of the circumstances, there are significant questions that need to be asked as to why the officers were inside the residence at all, at the moment the shots were fired” (quoted in Lupick 2016).</p>
<p>Of particular concern for investigators was the fact that the officers involved did not know who was in the house when they entered. This despite the obvious, acknowledged, presence of the mother and the opportunity to speak with her (as at least one officer did). The officer who shot Mutch claimed that he would have proceeded differently, setting up an armed barricade and not entering the house, if he had been aware that no one else was inside or that Mutch was suicidal (Petrescu 2016). The number of officers in a tight space was said to limit their options. Neither pepper spray nor baton were deemed viable in that context.</p>
<p>Despite the findings of the investigation and the description of what happened by Marney Mutch the Victoria Police Department continued to portray officers as trying to de-escalate the situation. In a statement released following the IIO report, Victoria police chief Del Manak stated:</p>
<p>“In addition to the grief and sorrow this has caused the family, this incident has had a profound effect on the officers who were involved. Despite their training, experience, the action plan they developed for this dynamic situation, and their attempts to de-escalate the situation, this incident ended in tragedy.” (quoted in Petrescu 2016)</p>
<p>Yet this was a tragedy that need not have occurred.</p>
<p>Victoria police were presented with the IIO report and insisted they will work with the Office of the Police Complaint Commissioner to examine departmental protocols. In a statement they claim: “we remain committed to continual assessment of our practices. This is especially important given the steadily increasing number of calls from the public requesting that our officers attend to people experiencing some form of crisis” (quoted in Petrescu 2016). Yet in case after case in the Canadian context, regardless of jurisdiction police are responding to people experiencing crisis with a “comply or die” focus, aggression, violence, and ultimately lethal force.</p>
<p>And when police act in these encounters they tend to act aggressively and quickly with no sense of attempts at de-escalation or communication. According to the IIO report, only between five and six minutes passed between the time at which Victoria police officers made contact with Mutch and the discharge of a firearm. As Lupick notes, that is significantly longer than is often the case in other police shootings in British Columbia. Lupick notes that there is a pattern in fatal encounters involving police and civilians in the province. It is, in fact, common for police to have fired their weapons within the first few minutes of contact with someone experiencing mental health issues or personal crisis, often discharging weapons within the first 60 seconds of contact (Lupick 2016). Clearly this shows that virtually no efforts are made a de-escalation or discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Following the release of the IIO investigation report Marney Mutch told reporters that in her view it was the actions of police and their hard response that led to an intensification of her son’s behavior. In particular she noted the presence of large, ominous looking, weapons, the number of officers confronting her son, five, and the fact that they cornered her son in a single room. In her view: “They created the situation that led to my son being shot” (quoted in Petrescu 2016).</p>
<p>She believes that her son Rhett did not want to die and would not have killed himself and she is confident that she was never in danger from her son. In her words: “There was nothing aggressive about him” (quoted in Petrescu 2016). In the view of Marney Mutch, and indeed of many commentators and critics, it is the wrong approach to aggressively confront someone, particularly with weapons, experiencing a mental health crisis (Petrescu 2016). She has added her voice to the call from others for improved training for police in dealing with people experiencing mental health emergencies.</p>

Both officers faced charges including manslaughter, but the charges were dropped when a provincial court judge ruled there wasn't enough evidence to proceed to trial. A judicial review of the case was denied.
<p>On Friday, November 24, 2017, the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice and Public Safety in New Brunswick announced a coroner’s inquest into the 2015 shooting of Michel Vienneau by Bathurst Police Force constables Patrick Bulger (38) and Mathieu Boudreau (28).</p>
<p>Michel Vienneau, a 51-year-old Tracadie resident, was shot and killed in a Bathurst Via Rail parking lot on January 12, 2015 after the two officers, who may not have been clearly identified, attempted to detain him. The police were acting on an anonymous tip that Vienneau was carrying “a load of drugs” with him as he returned from Montreal with his partner Annick Basque. The tip proved to be completely false and Vienneau had no criminal record. Constables Patrick Bulger and Mathieu Boudreau were charged with manslaughter by means of an unlawful act, assault with a weapon, and unlawfully pointing a firearm but were let off by provincial court Judge Anne Dugas-Horsman.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of the inquest announcement that he had requested, Nicolas Vienneau, the victim’s brother stated: “We have been living three years of hell” (quoted in MacKinnon 2017). Reflecting on the pain his mother (85) and father (88) have been through, he suggested that they are still “terrorized”: “It’s terrible to live like this” (quoted in 2017). In his view: “If we can find some justice, it will not [help my little brother], but maybe it will give us a little bit of peace” (quoted in MacKinnon 2017).</p>
<p>Only days before the inquest was announced, Crown prosecutors gave notice that they would not be appealing the court decision of February 24 , 2017, in which provincial court Judge Anne Dugas-Horsman decided to drop charges against the two killer cops. The announcement by prosecutors resulted in a lifting of the publication ban on the trial and raised serious questions about the court’s actions, as we reported at the time. The Crown had sought a judicial review of Judge Dugas-Horsman’s decision, seeking to have it overruled, but Court of Queen&#8217;s Bench Justice Tracey DeWare dismissed that application in October.</p>
<p>Nicolas Vienneau reports that the family is “still in shock” over the decision not to appeal (quoted in MacKinnon 2017). He is left to ask: “How can justice allow a person to be shot dead…sitting in his car in motion, by two policemen in civilian clothes…with [an] unmarked car?” (quoted in MacKinnon 2017). The short answer is that the killers were cops and in the Canadian context they are allowed to kill with impunity. But more detailed answers are needed. The family remains perplexed that civilian witnesses were not questioned during preliminary inquiry, which they view as inadequate.</p>
<p>Nicolas Vienneau plans to bring a petition to the House of Commons to have the identity of the Crime Stoppers tipster revealed. In his words: “My family still believes that the tipster of this false information…is the key to the puzzle” (quoted in MacKinnon 2017)</p>
<p>Bulger and Boudreau are still working as officers but face a professional conduct investigation by the New Brunswick Police Commission.

<p>Michel Vienneau, a 51-year-old man from Tracadie, New Brunswick, was shot and killed by Bathurst police officers Mathieu Boudreau (now 28) and Patrick Bulger (now 38) outside the Bathurst VIA Rail station on the morning of January 12, 2015. Despite serious questions about police killing of an innocent man under questionable circumstances, in which police had no “reasonable and probable” grounds to arrest, charges against the officers were dropped by provincial court Judge Anne Dugas-Horsman. Now that the Crown prosecutor has chosen not to appeal, the publication ban on evidence presented during the officers’ preliminary inquiry has been lifted. Emerging details raise further questions about the killer cops’ actions and the judge’s decision not to try their cases.</p>
<p>Police intercepted Vienneau as he arrived by train from a Montreal vacation with his common-law partner, Annick Basque. Police were acting on an unconfirmed and unverified anonymous tip that Vienneau was carrying an unspecified “load of drugs” back from Montreal with him. An RCMP investigation following Vienneau’s killing found that the tip was completely false. Vienneau not carrying any drugs, and he had no previous record with police. He was completely innocent of the claims made anonymously against him, yet police killed him shortly after encountering him. Constable Boudreau fired four shots at the victim who was inside his car at the time.</p>
<p>It seems that there was some pressure on Constable Bulger to make a big bust, and a concern that he might have missed it. When the tip came in just before 10 AM that morning, a supervisor is reported as saying to Bulger, “you missed a load this morning.”</p>
<p>Six police officers attended the Via Rail train station in Bathurst in three unmarked cars to intercept Vienneau. Curiously, they did not take the opportunity to arrest Vienneau immediately but instead waited until he and Basque disembarked the train, picked up their luggage and entered their vehicle.</p>
<p>Basque’s account of the police attempt to arrest Vienneau differs greatly from the one provided by the officers. She says that she did not even know that the men accosting them were police officers. When Bulger exited his car with a gun in his hands, she reports that Vienneau tried to drive by him, moving slowly. Basque suggests that when she heard gunshots her first thought was that the men were “going to kill everyone.”  Not realizing that they were police officers, she fought against her arrest until she recognized some uniformed officers.</p>
<p>The Crown’s case raised the fact that the police had no “reasonable and probable” grounds to arrest Vienneau in the first place because the tip police were acting on was unreliable and unverified. Details released reveal that the preliminary inquiry heard that less than an hour elapsed between the time police received the tip was and the time that they arrived at the train station. In fact, the tip was not investigated by police and, incredibly, several officers had not even read it fully.</p>
<p>In the decision of February 24 , 2017, provincial court Judge Dugas-Horsman stated that she simply did not feel Boudreau and Bulger had acted illegally. It seems that Judge Dugas-Horsman made several contortions of logic to let the police off. First, the judge found that &#8216;”not having reasonable and probable grounds&#8217;” for an arrest did not make for an unlawful arrest. She then said that technically an arrest never happened because, well the police killed Vienneau before he was fully under arrest (even though he was “technically” detained in his vehicle). The judge then gave officers another excuse, suggesting that officers have the right to stop vehicles under the Motor Vehicle Act. Judge Dugas-Horsman then went further offering the copaganda excuse that anyone disobeying a police order to stop (as Bulger says he did without independent confirmation of the order or whether Vienneau ever heard it if it were given). According to Dugas-Horsman (in full cop defense mode): “This failure to stop heightens the suspicion of a police officer, who is then entitled to wonder why the person is not stopping,.” The state protects the state and goes out of its way to do so in protecting killer cops.</p>
<p>The only testimony presented at the preliminary hearing, apart from that provided by Annick Basque, was provided by several police officers. The Vienneau family has raised questions about this. They ask why none of the civilians who were present at the train station were asked to provide their versions of what they witnessed that day. The family has also asked why no one has bothered to investigate where the anonymous, and false,  tip came from in the first place.</p>

<p>Constables Patrick Bulger (38) and Mathieu Boudreau (26) had each faced charges of manslaughter with a weapon, assault with a weapon, and unlawfully pointing a firearm for the shooting and killing of businessman Michel Vienneau on January 12, 2015 under highly questionable circumstances. The police had been given an erroneous anonymous “tip” that Vienneau was in possession of drugs when the officers confronted him outside the Bathurst, New Brunswick train station.</p>
<p>On October 20, 2017, Court of Queens Bench Judge Tracey DeWare upheld an earlier court decision dismissing the charges against the two constables. The evidence in the case still remains subject to a publication ban for at least 30 days, unless the ruling is appealed.</p>
<p>In February, provincial court Judge Anne Dugas-Horsman ruled, following a preliminary hearing, that the prosecution failed to produce enough evidence to warrant a trial. The judge dropped charges against the officers. New Brunswick’s Public Prosecutions Services challenged that ruling, arguing that the  the judge failed to consider all relevant evidence.</p>
<p>An RCMP investigation later found that Vienneau was not involved in any criminal activity. A civil lawsuit on behalf of Vienneau’s partner, who was accompanying him at the time he was killed, alleges that his death was caused by police negligence.</p>
<p>This decision is not surprising in the least since the state consistently protects the state in cases of police killings of civilians in Canada.</p>

<p>In the Canadian context, whether dealing with federal, provincial or municipal forces, it is extremely rare for police to be held in any way accountable when they kill people. On Thursday, November 19, 2015 one of those exceptional instances occurred when it was announced that two officers from the police force of Bathurst, New Brunswick have been charged in connection with the police killing of Michel Vienneau (51) on January 12 of the same year.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia RCMP, the force which had been charged with reviewing the case, announced that Constable Patrick Bulger, 38, of Beresford, and Constable Mathieu Boudreau, 26, of Dunlop, have each been charged with: manslaughter with a weapon; two counts of assault with a weapon; two counts of unlawfully pointing a firearm. Boudreau was identified as the officer who fired several times killing Vienneau. Both officers are to appear in provincial court in Bathurst on Jan. 4, 2016.</p>
<p>Vienneau was returning from a trip to Montréal with his partner Annick Basque when the couple were intercepted by the Bathurst police officers and shot and killed outside the city’s train station. According to court documents, Bathurst police received a Crime Stoppers tip that Vienneau would be on the train from Montréal and in possession of drugs. The Nova Scotia RCMP claimed, however, that their investigation found Vienneau not to be involved in any criminal activity.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia RCMP Inspector Larry Wilson met with media in Bathurst on Thursday but refused to answer many questions asked by reporters on grounds that the case was now before the courts. The New Brunswick Police Commission also announced on Thursday that Bathurst police Chief Eugène Poitras had filed a conduct complaint against the two officers charged in the shooting of Vienneau. That case was to be investigated by Moncton lawyer Judith Beglay but has now been suspended following the completion of criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>The two officers have been suspended but the Police Act conveniently allows only for suspensions with pay.</p>

<p>This does not answer why the Crown chose not to follow the ASIRT recommendation to charge the officer nor does it explain how breaking down a door and firing six shots at someone for holding a piece of plastic is justifiable or reasonable force, or does anything to protect the public. The state protects the state.</p>
<p>The Heffernan family had argued that the officer fired recklessly and wildly. They have filed a lawsuit against the police service.</p>
<p>The Calgary police force had been involved in six fatal police shootings over two years in 2015 and 2016.</p>

<p>In the Canadian state context it is exceedingly rare for police who kill civilians to be charged with a criminal offence, no matter how egregious or obviously criminal their actions are. Often times so-called oversight agencies will exonerate the officers (sometimes because they do not receive full or proper disclosure from obstructionist forces or police associations, as the Ontario Ombudsperson has reported). In other cases the Crown will operate to shield officers who kill by refusing to bring charges even where the oversight agency has found evidence of wrongdoing by police. By refusing to bring charges the Crown acts to protect killer police officers from having to defend their actions in court and foreclosing even the possibility of conviction. The decision to withhold charges also deprives the public, and family members of the victim, from learning the identity of the officers responsible as the bringing of charges is often the only mechanism by which the identities of killer police officers are revealed publicly. Given the close associations and mutual professional benefits of positive relations between police and prosecutors (and the more straightforward interest of the state in defending its own operators) the choice of prosecutors not to charge police even in cases of apparent wrongdoing is not overly surprising.</p>
<p>Yet it is still disappointing particularly for friends and family members of victims and for community advocates. Another such disappointing case of prosecutorial shielding of police came out of Alberta on August 22, 2016 when the Crown prosecutor chose not to bring charges against the officers who killed Anthony Heffernan (27) in 2015, despite the fact that the provincial oversight body, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), found evidence of police wrongdoing through their investigation. Incredibly, the officer who killed Anthony Heffernan has since gone on to kill another man, Dave McQueen, a man in a wheelchair, in 2016. Tellingly the killing of Anthony Heffernan was the closest any police officer has come to being criminally charged for killing someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comply or Die Policing Again: The Killing of Anthony Heffernan</p>
<p>Anthony Heffernan was a young man experiencing addiction and mental health issues who was shot multiple times and killed by police despite the fact that he was confined to a room in a Super 8 motel and posed no immediate danger to anyone but perhaps himself. Heffernan suffered three shots to the neck and head. The ASIRT report found that police could Heffernan through the partially opened hotel room door and they described him as “flushed, non-responsive and hyperventilating” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016). Police described the victim as being “in medical distress” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016) but there is no proper explanation as to why the response of officers was to shoot someone in distress, and confined to an enclosed space, multiple times. Heffernan was only holding a “small diabetic needle” with no point on it and a lighter. The entire incident lasted only 72 seconds. In that short amount of time police encountered, engaged, and killed a young man in distress and confined to a room.</p>
<p>This appears to be yet another case of “comply or die” policing in which someone is killed simply because they do not fulfill the authoritarian wishes of officers shouting commands. Indeed, in this case officers asserted that they shot Heffernan because he did not comply with their orders to drop the needle and lighter. A steep price to pay, summary execution, for failing to satisfy the authoritarian desires of police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>State Protecting State</p>
<p>The ASIRT report said that although “there is evidence capable of providing reasonable grounds to believe that an offence or offences have been committed, the Crown opinion has determined that the case does not meet the standard for prosecution” (quoted in Grant and Bell 2016). The family finds this twist of logic to be “shocking.”</p>
<p>To excuse their decision not to bring charges the Crown prosecutors, perhaps trying to defuse criticism of their controversial choice released a lengthy statement. It read in part:</p>
<p>“The evidence would be that he did so as a defensive action against an individual who was armed with a syringe, and who had been either unwilling or unable to comply with police directions.</p>
<p>“In all of these circumstances, it could not be disproven that the subject officer acted upon a reasonable belief that he and the other officers were at risk of serious or grievous bodily harm, and that his use of force was necessary.” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calgary Chief of Police Roger Chaffin responded by saying he stands by his officer despite noting that he has been reassigned while working “through his own, particular issues” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016). Notably the Chief of Police in Calgary has been so concerned with improper behavior in the force that he has gone on a public witch hunt against whistleblowers in the department who have spoken out against misconduct or named officers involved.</p>
<p>The lawyer for the Heffernan family, Tom Engel, notes that the officer involved in the shooting exercised his right to remain silent during the ASIRT investigation and refused even to give the police oversight agency his notes. This is an incredible privilege given police but denied civilians. It is one reason among many that so-called independent oversight agencies have been so ineffectual (or effective in shielding police) in every provincial context within the Canadian state. Notably, again, not bringing charges protects the officers from having to testify and hand over their notes so the Crown, even in this way, is protecting the officers from necessary public scrutiny regardless of a conviction or not.</p>
<p>The family is planning a civil suit against the police. This is often the last resort option to which families must turn simply to learn the names of officers involved in killing their loved one. In this case the family is hoping that the civil suit against Calgary Police Services and the officers who were in the Super 8 motel room will have to testify and turn over the notes. According to Tom Engel: “It just seemed that, with all those police officers in the room with all that fire power &#8230; [Anthony] was shot having nothing but a lighter in his hand and possibly approaching the officers, it’s a stretch to say it was a justifiable homicide” (quoted in Grant and Bell 2016).</p>
<p>Engel also points out the double standard that exists because officers are allowed to stay silent and keep their notes under the Police Act. Indeed officers are rarely if ever arrested when they kill someone, even under dubious circumstances. In Engel’s view:</p>
<p>“If the tables were reversed and Anthony Heffernan had killed a police officer, they would have arrested him on the spot and had him in for an intensive interrogation trying to break down his will to remain silent. But that’s not the case with a police officer, they don’t arrest him, they carry on an investigation for months or even years.” (quoted in Grant and Bell 2016)</p>
<p>In the case of a civil suit or fatality inquiry the officers would be compelled to testify and would have to turn over the notes. The officers were the only witnesses to the killing and their stories about what happened actually differed in key areas such as the movements of Heffernan before he was shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone in Contact with Police is at Tremendous Risk: the Family Responds</p>
<p>The family was devastated by the Crown decision. Given the circumstances around the killing of Anthony Heffernan they expected the bringing of a rare charge of murder against the officer responsible (who would kill again earlier this year). Anthony Heffernan&#8217;s mother, Irene, had hoped “clear and just thinking would prevail, but it didn’t” (quoted in 2016). Heffernan’s father Pat says his son’s killing shows that people are at risk any time they come into contact with police. In his words: “It’s a sad day for all Albertans and Canadians alike. There is no justice in this case. Anthony is dead, and anyone else who comes into contact with police is at tremendous risk &#8230; because they [officers] are going to be supporting each other in whatever needs to be said” (quoted in Grant and Fletcher 2016).</p>
<p>This is another case that begs us to ask deeper questions about why police are called in the first place. It raises the effects of social isolation and moral panics, around drug use or mental health, which lead people to call police for behavior that is not harming anyone but may be unusual or disturbing. This is a matter manufactured fear and dependence on authorities. And it ends with someone dead at the hands of police upset that their orders have not been obeyed and trained to shoot first, second, and always. And knowing they will not be held accountable for the great harm they do, for the lives they destroy.</p>

<p>In the Canadian state context there are few legal outcomes as rare as a police officer being convicted for killing a civilian. It is rare enough that an officer who kills someone is even charged for the taking of someone’s life. This is true even in those provinces that have separate investigations units that look into killings by police rather than simply turning a case over to another police force to “investigate.” Indeed as the recent decision by Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) not to bring charges in the police killing of Andrew Loku and ongoing criticisms of the backlogged Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia show, these agencies remain limited, and often impede by or too close to, police departments involved in killings. The Loku killing in particular has led to community mobilizations by Black Lives Matter Toronto and allies.</p>
<p>Still it is safe to assume that most residents of provinces that have a dedicated unit that investigates police killings of civilians, like Alberta, would expect that any officer involved in killing a civilian would, at the very least, be taken off of active street duty while under investigation or before any conclusions are released to the public. If an officer may have acted inappropriately, unduly, disgracefully it would only make sense that they would not be released upon the public until review of the officer, their outlook, and conduct was completed and some assessment made. Surely a killer cop would not be turned out on the streets to kill again.</p>
<p>Well, incredibly, stunningly, it seems that just such a situation has been allowed to happen in Alberta with, perhaps predictably, lethal consequences. On January 25, 2016 David McQueen, a quadriplegic, was shot by three Calgary police officers while in his wheelchair inside the doorway to his house. In March 2016 it was revealed that one of the officers who shot McQueen was, at the very moment he fired his weapon, under investigation by the province’s investigation unit ASIRT (Alberta Serious Incident Response Team) for killing another man a year earlier. And he had not been cleared of wrongdoing in the previous killing.</p>
<p>Less than a year before, on March 16, 2015, the officer who would be involved in McQueen’s killing, had shot Anthony Heffernan four times, three times in the head, while the young man was alone and in some distress, but defenseless, in a hotel room. In fact police broke down the door to forcibly enter Heffernan’s room in a Hotel 8 before shooting him.</p>
<p>Said Grant Heffernan, Anthony’s brother, upon hearing the news that the very cop who killed his brother had killed again: &#8220;I am more than outraged that this happened to somebody else in Calgary” (quoted in Grant 2016). The family had been told by ASIRT that as of November 2015 the officer had not returned to work but was actively trying to get back on the job (Grant 2016). Heffernan suggests that family could have dealt with the officer being placed on administrative duty, though they by no means saw this as ideal in the circumstances (Grant 2016). They were shocked that he had been returned to the streets. As Grant Heffernan said upon hearing that the same officer that killed his brother had killed again: &#8220;This is unfathomable that this happened and is totally unacceptable&#8221; (Grant 2016).</p>
<p>The Heffernan family lawyer echoed those sentiments. Tom Engel, commenting on the return of the officer to street duty ahead of being cleared by ASIRT and the Alberta Crown prosecutor:  &#8220;Frankly, it&#8217;s shocking. You have to respect the presumption of innocence. I don&#8217;t think that you should necessarily suspend the officer from all police duties, but you certainly would take him off the street so that he wouldn&#8217;t be in a position to do that again&#8221; (quoted in Grant 2016).</p>
<p>There are many questions to be answered in trying to figure out how a young man missing his check-out time could escalate so quickly to his being shot and killed by police. When he had no weapon and no capacity to harm the public (being isolated in a hotel room by himself).</p>
<p>There are also significant questions about how and why an officer under review for a killing of a civilian could be out on the streets to kill again. When a police officer is involved in a shooting, he or she is placed on a minimum 30 day administrative leave. At the end of that period, an evaluation is supposed to be undertaken to determine whether the officer can return to active duty and whether restrictions, and what type of restrictions, will be placed on them following their return. In this case it is not yet clear why the officer was allowed to return to the streets and what, if any, restrictions governed their activity.</p>
<p>On Thursday, March 17, 2016, the Heffernan family reported that the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team has finally told them that it has recommended murder charges. The decision to lay charges rests with the Crown prosecutors. In Grant Heffernan’s words: &#8220;ASIRT is pressing hard,&#8221; (Stark 2016). This is, of course, welcome news. Charges are, as we have noted, rarely laid against officers who kill civilians, even in instances where the case would appear straightforwardly to demand charges be brought.</p>
<p>The news from ASIRT has brought some comfort to the family. Grant Heffernan suggests it is helping their recovery: &#8220;I feel a little better about it. We were very skeptical about ASIRT and any officer being charged&#8221; (quoted in Stark 2016). The family will not know until May 1 whether the Crown will, in fact, follow through and lay charges against the officer.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the police have not responded formally to this news they did offer a rather arrogant, and perhaps knowingly confident, expression of their awareness that no homicide charges have ever been laid against a Calgary police officer (Stark 2016). Such has been too consistent practice in Canada when police brutalize or kill civilians.</p>
<p>The Heffernan family has filed a complaint under the Police Act. That case can go before the law enforcement review board even if charges are not formally laid against the officer (Grant 2016).</p>
<p>For Grant Heffernan there is only one appropriate outcome. That is to ensure that the cop cannot kill a third time. In his words: &#8220;The only way there is going to be any accountability and justice, is if the subject officer who killed my brother &#8230; faces criminal prosecution&#8221; (quoted in Grant 2016).</p>

Her son fled, but when police turned their attention to the mother Ekamba-Boekwa returned, knife in hand.

Investigators found no cause to lay charges against the officers.",Deadly Force (2018),
0074-V1,"Two Mounties responding to reports of a stabbing at a home were told by a witness who called 911 that someone inside the home was bleeding out, according to an independent investigation. Inside, the officers found Travis Rood, who was armed with a knife. One of the officers opened fire as Rood reportedly came toward him holding the weapon. When other officers arrived, Rood was handcuffed and taken to hospital, where he died from his wounds. An inquest held three years later ruled the cause of death ""undetermined.""
<p>A public inquest has been set to examine the killing of Travis Rood, a 35-year-old Burnaby man, by Burnaby RCMP on March 29, 2015. The BC Coroners Service has claimed that Rood suffered injuries “following an encounter with the attending officer” and has set the inquest for January 8, 2018 in Burnaby. Rood was shot by RCMP and died at Royal Columbian Hospital. The inquest cannot assign criminal responsibility and can only make recommendations that police are in no way obligated to adopt.</p>
",Deadly Force (2018),
0075-V1,"Beau Baker told a 911 operator he had a knife and intended to hurt himself and others, an independent investigation found. The first officer to arrive on scene told the investigation that Baker refused commands to drop the knife, and instead threatened to stab the officer. When Baker approached, the officer fired at him several times and he was pronounced dead in hospital. No charges were laid against the officer, but his family is suing the police for $6 million.
<p>It happens far too often in Canada. A person experiences emotional distress or mental health issues. Someone observing contacts authorities. Rather than a health care worker, police are sent to the scene. Instead of acting in a helpful caring way, they quickly resort to orders and violence. And someone who could and should be supported ends up dead. Police who kill people under such circumstances are almost never held accountable by the criminal justice system. Now families may be beginning to turn attention to the violation of human rights that occurs when someone suffering mental illness is treated with violence because they are suffering mental illness or distress.</p>
<p>On April 2, 2015, Waterloo Regional police in Kitchener, Ontario shot Beau Baker seven times, killing him. At the time police engaged him Baker was suffering through a mental health crisis. Police were aware of this but still did nothing to calm him or deescalate or involve mental health care workers. Rather they took the typical authoritarian command approach that has led to numerous documented injuries and deaths at the hands of police in Canada. As family lawyer Davin Charney suggests: “That type of command (approach) doesn’t work for people in a mental crisis” (quoted in Sher 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mental Health and Human Rights Violations by Police</p>
<p>Police in Canada have a dubious history of killing people experiencing mental health crises. The too often employed response is one of confrontation, order, escalation, and, finally, force, often times lethal. Approaches that acknowledge distress and seek communicative alternatives are rarely used. And outcomes are predictably deadly. As Charney notes: “It’s playing out across the country again and again. Beau did not deserve to die” (quoted in Sher 2016). It seems to have become too easy for police to quickly resort to lethal force in such cases. With impunity.</p>
<p>Beau Baker’s mental illness now forms a basis for a lawsuit claiming that police discriminated against him in a way that violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Ontario Human Rights Code. On April 4, 2016, the family and estate of Beau Baker filed a six million dollar lawsuit claiming that the young man was killed by Waterloo Regional police without provocation and in violation of his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The lawsuit further charges that the police knew that Baker was mentally ill when they encountered him and then tried to cover up their misdeed. The lawsuit also names Waterloo Regional police Chief Brian Larkin and the police services board as defendants.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that the 20-year-old victim was standing with his arms above his head, holding a beer in one hand and a knife in the other, when one of two police officers who had guns pointed at him fired seven times, with one bullet severing his aorta, killing him. According to the lawsuit’s statement of claim: “(Beau) was not moving towards either officer. After he was shot, Beau fell to the ground in the exact same spot that he had been standing when the first officer had arrived” (quoted in Sher 2016). This is supported by eyewitness testimony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not So Special Investigations</p>
<p>In response to notice of the lawsuit, Waterloo Regional police Staff Sgt. Mike Haffner issued a statement: “Any death in our community is tragic. With the loss by the Baker family, they have decided to take legal action against the service. It would be inappropriate for the service to comment as this process has just commenced” (quoted in Sher 2016).</p>
<p>As is typically the case in the Canadian context details of the killing, including the names of officers involved have not been revealed to the family or the public. This is an issue that deeply troubles critics as well as advocates for public transparency and openness in government and public institutions. Transparency and openness are by no means hallmarks of policing in Canada. Indeed secrecy, protections, and the blue wall of silence (reinforced by public agencies like the SIU) are the order of the day. In this the often self-congratulatory Canadian systems could learn from examples in the United States in which officers are named publicly, often fairly soon after an incident of police violence.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the provincial agency that investigates cases of police encounters that involve civilian injury or death, had assigned eight investigators to probe the shooting. It is by now well established, through reviews and reports released by the provincial ombudsperson, that police obstruct, deceive, and lie to the SIU. The lawsuit in this case claims that officers did not provide truthful statements to the SIU investigators. According to the lawsuit: “The officers made false and self-serving statements to the SIU with the purpose of avoiding criminal liability. The [officers] intentionally misled the SIU and corrupted the investigation into the death of Beau” (quoted in Sher 2016).</p>
<p>The SIU concluded that the officer who fired the shots and killed Baker was justified in doing so. This conclusion was based on the reports of officers. In what can only be described as a perverse, even sadistic, assessment, the SIU went so far as to claim that the officer who killed Baker was justified in firing seven shots because the young victim did not fall until the last shot was fired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternative Views</p>
<p>Yet the perspectives and testimony of witnesses suggest something other than the SIU sanctioned version of events. Witness Muhammad Zafar, 46, reported seeing the shooting from his cousin’s apartment across the street. In his view: “There was a guy with a knife in front of the building. It looked like a kitchen knife. He was saying something and police were also saying something” (quoted in Carruthers 2015a).</p>
<p>Another witness Dan Mazurek said he saw the shooting from the vantage point of his fourth-floor balcony. He reported the killing as follows: “A lady who lived in the apartment, who was a friend of the guy who got (shot), she was yelling and crying to the cop to not shoot him. I saw the cop with his gun drawn and this guy sitting on the ground” (quoted in Carruthers 2015a). According to Mazurek, he heard five gunshots from the officer, who was standing about three to 4 1/2 meters from the victim.</p>
<p>Notably, Mazurek reported that Baker was never close to the officer. He also noted that there was no attempt by police at de-escalation and the shooting came very early into the encounter. In Mazurek’s view: “The kid was nowhere near him. I did not see any [de-escalation] and within two seconds onto the balcony, the cop fired off five shots. There was another female cop behind her door of the police car” (quoted in Carruthers 2015a).</p>
<p>Witnesses and friends alike cannot fathom why police responded with lethal force. Those questions remain. Beau Baker’s friend Crystal Pettigrew remembered: “He’s not a violent person and he would never hurt anyone. I think everybody just wants real answers. They didn’t have to kill him” (quoted in Carruthers 2015b)</p>
<p>Another friend Gracelynn Fortin, 16, spoke with Baker an hour before he was killed by Waterloo police. She echoes the view of others that her friend was kind and unthreatening. In her view: “Beau wouldn’t dare try and hurt someone. He was not a violent person. He was probably the most kind, caring person you could ever meet” (quoted in Carruthers 2015b). She believes that if anything he was raising a “cry for help” the night he was killed (Carruthers 2015b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>While police only ever seem to see a threat, or a target, people who knew Baker recall a loving, kind artist. Indeed, according to family Beau Baker had plans to be a tattoo artist and was trying to put together the equipment to start his career. It was something at which he was said to be quite talented.</p>
<p>His mother, Jackie Baker, remembers a loving son. In her words: “Beau was one of the most thoughtful and loving people I have ever met. Since he was a young boy he made gifts for people. He bought me a rose for one of my birthdays and I still have the petals” (quoted in Sher 2016). She suggests that her son’s battles with anxiety worsened following the death in 2011 of a grandmother who was his best friend. This led to a turn to smoking pot and eventually drinking. Jackie Baker has a chilling recollection of the last time she spent and her son spent together:</p>
<p>“The day before he was taken from his two brothers and myself I had met him at the doctor’s office to get a new prescription for his medication. I gave him a new shirt in an army green colour. We parted ways at the bus stop and I gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek and told him I love him. As I walked away I kept looking back for some reason.” (quoted in Sher 2016)</p>
<p>Her son is among the victims of people dealing with mental health issues who are killed by police in Canada. It is a long and troubling list. One that shows have inappropriate, and unacceptable, it is to have police intervening in cases of mental stress and illness.</p>

<p>Andrew Loku (45), a refugee from South Sudan who suffered PTSD from experiences of torture, was shot and killed by Toronto police officer Andrew Doyle on July 5, 2015. On Friday, June 30, 2017, jury members in a coroner’s inquest into the killing ruled that his death was a homicide. Unfortunately, the Special Investigations Unit, the oversight body that examines cases of police harm to civilians had already decided, in March 2016, that Constable Doyle would not face criminal charges</p>
<p>The month long inquest headed by Dr. John Carlisle had gone beyond previous coroner’s inquests into police killings by actually addressing, at least in part, the role of racism in policing as influencing the actions of Constable Doyle and his partner Haim Queroub and contributing to their lethal use of force. During the inquest officer Doyle admitted to having almost no experiences interacting with Black men (Perkel 2017). Neighbors described Mr. Loku, a father of five, as a sweet man. Doyle and Queroub responded to him as something else. Lawyers argued that the officers’ fear of Black men contributed to their violent actions. It seems the inquest jury agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 39 Steps</p>
<p>The inquest jury made 39 recommendations which were read into the record by by coroner John Carlisle Among the recommendations are these:</p>
<p>Training police on implicit bias and anti-black racism.</p>
<p>Collecting race-based data, to be made public, and funding research to analyze the data.</p>
<p>Equipping police cars with less lethal means of force, including shields and helmets.</p>
<p>Allowing front-line officers to be equipped with Tasers.</p>
<p>Additional training for 911 operators to elicit more information during a call that can help aid in de-escalation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canadian Mental Health Association executive director Steve Lurie noted: “You have to pass a test on whether you know how to fire a gun, but you don’t have to pass a test on whether you know how to de-escalate” (quoted in Ghebreslassie 2017a).</p>
<p>The inquest ruling said that police officers should be exposed “to the perspectives and lived experience of racialized communities, the Black community and individuals with mental health issues and/or addictions.” Among the recommendations provided by the jury was that police be required to measure the effectiveness of training related to “anti-black racism and persons in crisis” through means of written and oral examinations. Officers should also be tested for implicit racial bia, and re-attend the training if they fail any of these.</p>
<p>Loku family lawyer Jonathan Shime said to reporters afterward that Andrew Loku should not have had to die for recommendations like these to raised and implemented. In his words: “To be frank, Andrew’s not here, and this whole inquest was necessary because somebody died and children are now without their father and sisters are now without their brother&#8221; (quoted in Ghebreslassie 2017a). This is the underlying truth in this.</p>
<p>On the whole the recommendations are not remarkable and some have been raised too many time before. They do not address the structural role of police and policing within state capitalist political economies and do not address their ongoing systemic measures as upholders of settler colonialism, white supremacy, and exploitation. But, that, of course will not be addresses through any state venue such as an inquest. The community groups and mobilizations around police racism and violence have shown the real possibilities for change and the necessity for change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Institutional Racism and Police Violence</p>
<p>Observers of the inquest have commended the fact that finally an inquest has highlighted intersections between racialization, racism, mental health, and police violence. In Shime’s words: “The reality is a disproportionate number of black men are dying at the hands of police, and it’s time for that to stop. We need to reduce that to zero” (quoted in Ghebreslassie 2017a). As Shime and others have noted, the inquest made very clear that racism contributed to the police killing of Andrew Loku and officers did not need to use lethal force against him. The recommendations address, if insufficiently, issues of explicit, conscious, as well as implicit, subconscious, racism.</p>
<p>The inquest had heard how six people in the apartment complex had interacted with Loku ahead of the arrival of police. Neighbors said that they said they had been able to calm Mr. Loku down and that, in fact, he was about to hand over the hammer he was holding when the police officers charged onto the floor and confronted him (Perkel 2017). Within around 20 seconds of their arrival Constable Doyle fired twice, hitting Mr. Loku on the left side of his chest.</p>
<p>Shime argued that the officers panicked, in part because Andrew Loku was Black. In his words: “I don’t think Andrew needed to die. There were a number of failings with respect to the training and the handling of this situation that precipitated his death” (quoted in Perkel 2017). The issues go well beyond training of course.</p>
<p>Kingsley Gilliam, with the Black Action Defence Committee, identified systemic racism. In his words, following the inquest: “They recognized that anti-black racism, racism and institutional racism are problems and that racism permeates society” (quoted in Perkel 2017). Gilliam, went further, calling Loku’s death “an execution” (quoted in Perkel 2017).</p>
<p>Lawyer Selwyn Pieters, also with the Black Action Defence Committee, called out the stereotyping of Black men as aggressive and violent. In his words: “When you stereotype black people, particularly men that way, it is more likely to lead to very unfortunate outcomes for black men” (quoted in Perkel 2017). For Constable Doyle it seems that the stereotypes were all that he drew on in the encounter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter: Community Mobilization is Key</p>
<p>Pieters further said that there will be community mobilization if the recommendations of this inquest are not implemented. Clearly community members will we watching to see what happens with the recommendations. Pieters told reporters that the BADC wants to see all 39 of the inquest recommendations implemented within one year, along with those of an ongoing police oversight review by Justice Michael Tulloch, or there will be an active response. In the words of BADC member Kingsley Gilliam: “We are going to hold their feet to the fire” (quoted in Ghebreslassie 2017b).</p>
<p>The significant role of Black Lives Matter and other community organizers has to be acknowledged and lauded, both in initiating the inquest and in seeing issues of racism addressed. They also have to be lauded for broadly reframing public perceptions of policing in general. As Pieters suggests:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There’s advocacy in the court and there&#8217;s street advocacy. You’ve seen Black Lives Matter were outside of police headquarters for two weeks to get this Loku inquest. I’m sure they’ll be watching this inquest with interest and they will respond appropriately if the recommendations aren’t implemented. They fought for this” (quoted in Ghebreslassie 2017b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s ruling is not a criminal one, as the Loku family&#8217;s lawyer Jonathan Shime explained outside of the inquest Friday. In a coroner&#8217;s inquest, the word is used to mean a death was the result of someone&#8217;s action.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A report published by the <em>Toronto Star</em> In August 2015, one month after Andrew Loku was shot and killed by Toronto police officer Andrew Doyle, found that, of the 51 fatal shootings involving the Toronto police between 1990 and 2015, at least 18 involved Black men (Gillis 2017). This represented 35 percent of fatal police shootings (Gillis 2017). In another 17 cases, or 33 percent, the racialized background of the victim of the police killing was deemed not identifiable with certainty (Gillis 2017). The population of Black people in Toronto over that time was approximately nine percent. Despite this fact there had been reluctance by some, including the coroner, as well as expected opposition from police, to address the issue of institutional racism among police head on and by name in the inquest into Andrew Loku’s killing by police.</p>
<p>Marianne Wright, the lawyer representing Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders, said parties to the inquest “should stick to the notions which are within the scope of the inquest. I’m struggling with the emotional content of the word racism” (quoted in Gillis 2017). Others struggled with the emotional content of racism itself and the racist actions of killer cops in Toronto.</p>
<p>Howard Morton, the lawyer for community group Across Boundaries, a mental health organization working for racialized communities and the organization that called McKenzie as a witness, argued that there was “nothing wrong with confronting a live issue like racism. To deprive me of the use of the word racism . . . it just confounds me and I’m flummoxed to the nth degree about why we’re all afraid of that term” (quoted in Gillis 2017).</p>
<p>The discussion of institutional racism centered on the looming testimony of Dr. Kwame McKenzie, a psychiatrist and the director of health equity at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, who was set to address organizational practices and racism. His work argues that organizations need to acknowledge that racism exists in their institutions in order to effect change.</p>
<p>Coroner and inquest head Dr. John Carlisle ruled late Monday, June 19, in the third week of the inquest, that “questions of the witness will not explore the topic of racism” (quoted in Gillis 2017). That decision led to an application from Black Action Defence Committee (BADC) lawyer Selwyn Pieters requesting a reconsideration. Pieters’ application asked that McKenzie “be permitted to testify in respect to racism&#8230;particularly systemic and institutional racism” (quoted in Shahzad 2017). In his words: “It is a manifest error in the context of this case to speak of implicit bias and exclude racism. Racism is the elephant in the room in this case” (quoted in Gillis 2017). Implicit bias had been addressed by psychology professor Dr. Nicholas Rule in the inquest’s second week, but institutional racism itself had not been explicitly discussed.</p>
<p>Dr. Carlisle’s ruling was not overturned but council reached an agreement that discussion of institutional racism would not be prohibited. In Pieter’s words: “Today, the witness was able to be questioned unimpeded and to delve into the issue of racism, and anti-Black racism, and I think we made some headway” (quoted in Gillis 2017). He continued: “Dr. McKenzie was able to give us evidence unimpeded in respect to racism and what institutional structures need to be changed in order to foster a culturally inclusive environment that is free from racism” (quoted in Shahzad 2017).</p>
<p>For his part, when questioned about institutional racism at the inquest, Dr. McKenzie noted that “training by itself won’t make the difference&#8230;more has to happen throughout the institution” (quoted in Shahzad 2017). Yet policing in Canada is founded in colonial and racist violence. Policing institutions have had generations to change but no impetus to do so.</p>
<p>Idil Abdillahi, a former board chair for Across Boundaries, concluded: “We can’t ignore that this man was a Black man. This active refusal to engage race and racism is what we see playing out here” (quoted in Gillis 2017). It is the racism at the heart of policing in Canada.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Haim Queroub, the second cop in the Toronto police killing of Andrew Loku, finally spoke publicly during the coroner’s inquest into Loku’s death. Queroub, had been on the force only 11 weeks when he and shooter Andrew Doyle encountered and killed Andrew Loku in the hallway outside his apartment on July 5, 2015. Queroub used his time on the stand to hint that Loku’s  death was a “suicide by cop.”</p>
<p>Queroub testified that when he and officer Doyle shouted at Andrew Loku, the distressed man said, “What ya gonna do &#8230; Come on &#8230; Shoot me.” Here Queroub is trying to plant the notion of suicide by cop, a bogus excuse that killer cops and their police associations routinely use to be let off for killing civilians under a range of situations which are not suicides. Yet, as lawyers at the inquest pointed out these words could well have been spoken as questions (asking if the cops were seriously going to kill him for standing outside his apartment with a hammer). Queroub said he could not clarify whether the words he believes he heard were actually a question. Clearly in raising this, though, he is attempting to present the possibility of &#8220;suicide by cop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Queroub’s testimony did confirm that the two officers had no discussion about nor plan to pursue de-escalation or to address someone potentially in distress. Incredibly both officers testified that they talked about how to get to the scene but not what they would do once they got there. There was no dialogue with Loku. Instead he was shot and killed within 21 seconds of police encountering him.</p>
<p>Clearly, as critics have suggested, police training is not the issue. Queroub testified he had received training both on interacting with people with mental health issues and on implicit bias when dealing with racialized people and communities. He even testified he had received de-escalation training. Yet <em>none</em> of these came into use when officers Queroub and Doyle encountered Andrew Loku and chose to shoot him within a mere 21 seconds. Queroub testified he did not even consider the man’s  distress or how to deal with it appropriately.</p>
<p>And he concluded that if he had to do it over again, he would not change anything. Police do not need to because they will not be held to account for killing civilians. And they know it. Instead phony “suicide by cop” claims, or other measures, will be used to get them off or help them to sleep at night.</p>

<p>Finally, nearly two years after Toronto police gunned down Andrew Loku, Constable Andrew Doyle has been identified publicly as the officer who pulled the trigger. Doyle took the stand Wednesday, June 14, 2017, during the second week of testimony in the coroner’s inquest into Loku’s killing by police. Doyle and Haim Queroub had only been identified as the officers involved in Loku’s killing during a previous session of the current inquest. The one who did the shooting had not been identified.</p>
<p>Doyle raised his firearm, pointing it at Loku, almost immediately upon encountering the man, a refugee from South Sudan. Evidence presented previously at the inquest, including the surveillance video of the encounter, shows that Loku was shot within 19 seconds of officers Andrew Doyle  and Haim Queroub encountering him. Earlier testimony from psychology professor Nicholas Rule shows implicit bias against Black men in Canadian and US contexts, including increased perceptions of threat. Community groups want the inquest to address issues of racism in the very quick deployment of lethal force against Andrew Loku, who witnesses and video suggest was not actively threatening the officers.</p>
<p>On the stand officer Doyle said coldly: “We’re trained to stop the threat. Two rounds stops the threat. He immediately fell to the ground. There was no need for anything else.”  Doyle said he had no training in alternative methods to disarm the man. Despite the blood pooling under Andrew Loku’s body, Doyle said his main concern was to make sure the dead man did not have another weapon.</p>

<p>Coroner’s inquests in the Canadian context never get to the heart of issues like racism and policing let along fundamental structures of policing like policing and white supremacy or policing and colonialism. Such inquests are generally limited to the specific actions of a particular event. The coroner’s inquest into the Toronto police killing of Andrew Loku, a refugee from  Sudan who suffered PTSD as a result of being kidnapped and tortured there, will likely be no different. Still community groups like the Black Action Defence Committee, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health’s Empowerment Council, and Across Boundaries, a group that provides mental health support for racialized communities in Toronto, are working to ensure larger issues of racialization, racism, and mental health are at least addressed. They have secured participant status.</p>
<p>On Monday, June 12, 2017, at the beginning of the inquest’s second week, the jury heard testimony from Dr. Nicholas Rule, an associate professor of psychology, and Canada Research Chair in social perception and cognition at the University of Toronto who carries out research on implicit bias. Rule was designated as an expert in social perception and cognition for the inquest. Dr. Rule’s testimony focused on issues related to implicit bias involving race or mental health status, and how this might impact the decisions made by police officers in the course of policing. According to Rule’s research, as given in his testimony to the inquest, implicit bias can make a young Black man appear taller, heavier, and, thus, more dangerous. According to Rule, this distortion of reality can affect both white people and Black people.</p>
<p>Rule presented results of research undertaken with two American academic colleagues examining the impact of race on the often very quick judgments people make in assessing others whom they encounter. That study, published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> earlier in 2017, examined people’s perceptions of Black men in terms of their size and, presumably relatedly, their threat level. The study, which included Canadian and American participants of a variety of racialized identities presented with a series of tests, concluded that regardless of their own “race,” participants perceived Black men as taller, heavier, more muscular, and more physically threatening than white men.</p>
<p>According to the researchers: “Black men tend to be stereotyped as threatening and, as a result, may be disproportionately targeted by police even when unarmed. Here, we found evidence that biased perceptions of young Black men’s physical size may play a role in this process” (Wilson, Hugenberg, and Rule 2017). Rule noted at the inquest that the participants in the study were not identified as police officers. The researchers did not examine possible intersections of racism and presence of a weapon.</p>
<p>It is likely that the notion of implicit bias is as far as the inquest will get in terms of addressing issues of and related to racism. The ongoing histories of white supremacy and colonialism in Canadian policing will likely not be on the agenda.</p>
<p>During the first week of the inquest, Toronto Constables Andrew Doyle and Haim Queroub were finally identified as the officers involved in killing Andrew Loku, thought which one pulled the trigger has not yet been revealed publicly. Both officers are expected to testify later during this second week of the inquest.</p>

<p>The Toronto police officers who killed Andrew Loku on July 5, 2015, have finally been identified as Constables Andrew Doyle and Haim Queroub. They were named as the officer’s involved on July 9, 2017, during the coroner’s  inquest into Loku’s killing when police lawyer Gary Clewley asked the men to rise from their seats to be identified by a witness. Even now, however, it was not said which of the two officers shot Loku. That identification is, after all this time, expected to come during the second week of the inquest when the officers are set to testify.</p>
<p>Video surveillance footage of events prior to the shooting of Loku in the hallway outside his apartment shows that he was not threatening his neighbors as he has been accused of. The neighbors do not appear afraid of him and some speak with him though there is no audio in the footage. Neighbor and witness Robin Hicks claimed on the stand that she was afraid <em>for</em> Loku not <em>of</em> Loku when police arrived. The footage also shows Loku holding a hammer in a manner that does not appear to be threatening (not fully by the handle).</p>
<p>Still, police shot and killed Andrew Loku within 19 seconds of encountering him and within only five minutes of the 911 call that apparently brought them. Because the state protects the state, the killer cops Andrew Doyle and Haim Queroub have already been cleared by the Special Investigations Unit.</p>

<p>The coroner’s inquest into the police killing of Andrew Loku began in Toronto on Monday, June 5, 2017. Loku, a 45-year-old refugee from South Sudan who struggled with mental health issues after having been kidnapped and tortured there, was shot and killed by Toronto police as he stood in his apartment hallway on July 5, 2015. On Thursday, June 8, 2017, the 911 call that preceded his killing was released as part of the inquest.</p>
<p>The call reveals that police waited no more than 19 seconds after encountering Loku before shooting and killing him. He had stood in the hallway without harming anyone for at least four minutes and forty seconds before police arrived. The two officers, one a coach and the other a new recruit with only a few months on the job, are immediately heard on the tape telling Loku to drop his perceived weapon, a hammer he held at his side.  Indistinct noises, mostly yelling by police, follow over the 19 seconds. And then. Two very distinct gunshots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 911 caller, distraught: “Oh, my god. Oh, my god.”</p>
<p>The 911 operator: “What was that?”</p>
<p>The caller: “That was gunshots. Gunshots from the police officer.”</p>
<p>A male voice then breaks through telling everyone to stay in their apartments. This is repeated by the operator.</p>
<p>Then the caller, in pained recognition: “They killed him?”</p>
<p>The operator: “Oh, my. What?”</p>
<p>Then, sadly, a child, softly: “He’s dead?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, violent force was first and foremost on the officers’ minds. There was no, even minimal, attempt to interact humanly with Andrew Loku. Never mind de-escalation, because the police were the only ones to escalate in the first place. Nineteen seconds was all they gave him.</p>

<p>Andrew Loku was shot and killed by a Toronto police officer on July 5, 2015. On Monday June 5, 2017 a coroner’s inquest opened into the killing. An autopsy found that Loku had been shot twice in the chest. He died of the gunshot wounds at the scene. The killing raised deeply troubling questions about the rapidity of police use of force, anti-Black racism on the Toronto force, and police mistreatment of people who may need mental health supports. Loku’s killing by the still unnamed officer sparked demonstrations by community members and Black Lives Matter movements.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old father of five, originally from South Sudan where he suffered kidnapping and torture, was confronted by two Toronto officers in the hallway of an apartment building on Gilbert Avenue near Rogers Road and Caledonia Road in the city’s west end. Following the killing there were calls to identify the officers involved and charge them and to release video footage of the interaction and shooting. As one close friend of Andrew Loku, Kiden Jonathan, who had been with his friend hours before he was killed, has said publicly: “We had a lot of questions, and we didn’t have any answers about what happened that night” (quoted in Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>Calls for an inquest in the killing of Andrew Loku have come from many different sources. These include members of Loku’s family, the Canadian Mental Health Association, the African Canadian Legal Clinic, Alok Mukherjee, former chair of the Toronto Police Service Board, and Black Lives Matter Toronto.</p>
<p>The coroner’s inquest into Loku’s killing will be presided over by coroner Dr. John Carlisle. Several community groups have sought participant status in the inquest. They include the CMHA, the Black Action Defence Committee, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health’s Empowerment Council, and Across Boundaries, a groups provides support and services to racialized communities dealing with mental health issues (Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No Accountability: A Flawed SIU Investigation</p>
<p>While there should be no illusions about the coroner’s inquest, and its limited scope of action, it is hoped that the inquest will provide some answers to serious questions about Andrew Loku’s killing. These include the identities of the two officers directly involved.</p>
<p>The officer who killed Loku had already been exonerated by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines police harm to civilians in Ontario, in March 2016. The SIU declared the shooting “legally justified,” a typical response to police killings of civilians in Canada.</p>
<p>This decision drew outrage from community members, policing critics, and Black Lives Matter organizers. A space in front of Toronto Police Headquarters was occupied following the decision to clear the officer who killed Loku. Black Lives Matter Toronto held the space for 15 days in protest against ongoing racism, lack of transparency, and lack of accountability in both policing and oversight. Community members also held a vigil outside the home of Premier Kathleen Wynne, head of provincial government.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the SIU claim that the officer who killed Loku was worried about a hammer Loku was said to be holding, evidence suggests another story. Steve Lurie, Executive Director of the Canadian Mental Health Association in Toronto, has called for the inquest based on evidence that contradicts the SIU and police story. In his words: “We have evidence that Andrew was calm at the time of his shooting” (quoted in CBC News 2017).</p>
<p>Two issues call into question the conclusions of the SIU. First is the actual account of an eye witness who has said that Loku did not pose any threat to anyone at the time of his killing. According to Loku’s neighbor, Robin Hicks, who witnessed the police killing: “Andrew died right in front of me. There was no reason for it” (quoted in Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>Second are the serious questions about surveillance video from the shooting.  According to police and the SIU, the video cameras at the scene were not functioning that night, and, even more curious, cut out right in the crucial moment before Loku is shot by the officer (Gillis 2017a). The video that does exist apparently shows Loku moving very slowly with the hammer down at his side, his behavior in no way threatening.</p>
<p>As troubling is the fact that Immediately after the shooting, a Toronto police officer tried to review and download the video (Gillis 2017a). Incredibly, this is activity that even the SIU called “improper” yet they did not probe this further in their investigation. This is more evidence of the ongoing, and unpunished, practices of police to interfere with, obstruct, and predetermine the SIU investigations. The SIU have themselves long documented and complained about such practices but there are no mechanisms used to make police comply with investigative policies and procedures (legal mechanisms ate available but are, again, rarely if ever used to hold police accountable).</p>
<p>The SIU’s decision renewed ongoing concerns about police oversight in Ontario. The SIU is lauded by government proponents as the “gold standard” of police oversight internationally. Yet SIU investigations have been undermined by obstruction and harassment from police, which are not properly dealt with, and plagued by a repeated lack of transparency regarding decision-making and real questions about the degree to which officers have actually been held accountable (Gillis 2017a). These problem have been documented in detail within this project.</p>
<p>So questionable was the SIU decision in this case that it, along with the community protests, contributed to the initiation of the provincial review of police oversight by Ontario Court of Appeal Justice Michael Tulloch, which made recommendations around transparency and police compliance. Public concern over the case led to the unprecedented release in 2016 of the SIU director’s report into Loku’s killing. Yet that document was heavily redacted and not particularly insightful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intersections of State Violence: Police, Racism, and Mental Health</p>
<p>Toward the end of 2016 a coalition of community groups sent a letter to presiding coroner Carlisle requesting that he broaden the scope of the inquest to examine the intersecting roles of race and mental in the officer’s quick decision to view Loku as a threat and to kill him. The November 2016 submission by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Law Union of Ontario, Ryerson University’s criminology department and others notes that the inquest cannot hope to live up to its stated purpose of preventing future deaths if, in their words “Mr. Loku’s race, immigration and mental health status are kept out of the inquest process” (quoted in Gillis 2017a). Unfortunately coroner’s inquests are rather functional, examining specific circumstances of a particular death and do not analyse broader systemic issues of inequality and injustice as are in fact crucial to understanding state violence.</p>
<p>Some groups have requested standing in the inquest in order to raise significant questions about race and mental health that would otherwise be overlooked by such an inquest. Howard Morton, lawyer for the group Across Boundaries, explains that if granted status the group hopes to examine key issues of intersectionality. In particular there is a need to address why Black men who are suffering from mental health issues are so often the victims of fatal encounters with police officers (Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>In fact, the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) leased units inside the building in which Loku was killed. The apartments provide housing for people with mental health challenges. The inquest should, at minimum, address the extent to which police officers were aware that Loku’s address was connected to the CMHA, an indication that some residents deal with mental health challenges (Gillis 2017a).</p>
<p>In the words of Kingsley Gilliam, a spokesperson for the Black Action Defence Committee, outside the courtroom on Monday: “He did not need to die. We need a shift in paradigm, where we shift crisis intervention away from police” (quoted in Gillis 2017b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Inquest</p>
<p>The inquest, with a jury of five members, is slated to last three weeks and hear from around 20 witnesses. The inquest has no powers and will simply make recommendations to prevent similar deaths. These are typically ignored or selectively implemented, but not necessarily practiced after implementation, by police. There can be no criminal findings and no charges can result. No findings for compensation can be offered. Inquests can lead to the naming of killer cops and are some of the only, very limited, means for doing so in the Canadian context.</p>
<p>Expectations for the inquest should be tempered given its limited scope and powers. There have already been numerous inquests into police violence and the killing of civilians. All that they have really done is to highlight that the police in Canada are brutal and kill a stunningly large number of people. And they kill Black people and people dealing with mental health issues with haste.</p>
<p>The previous inquests have made recommendations around increased de-escalation training and reducing stigmatization for people dealing with mental health issues. Training has not translated into action and, really, serves largely as window dressing for police forces and means of extra pay for officers. And, of course, we can never forget that police are instituted and officers paid to kill.</p>

",Deadly Force (2018),
0084-V1,"After noticing James Reginald Butters (James Hayward) matched a description provided over dispatch, an officer turned on his cruiser lights and pulled over to question the man, an officer told an independent investigation. However, Butters sprinted past the vehicle toward another officer with a knife in hand. Butters was shot and killed. His family said he suffered from mental health issues, and referred to the incident as a plea for help.",Deadly Force (2018),
0085-V1,"RCMP went to a public hearing after reports of a disturbance and found James Daniel McIntyre in a Guy Fawkes mask. An independent investigation confirmed that McIntyre, associated with the hacker group Anonymous, was not the subject of the original complaint, but police said he had a closed switchblade in his palm and refused commands to drop it. Police pepper-sprayed him, but it was ineffective, and when McIntyre came toward police with the knife, one of the officers shot him. The investigation revealed the whole encounter lasted no more than 21 seconds. The investigation cleared the officers.
<p>There is little expectation that officers who kill civilians in Canada will be in any way held accountable (even minimally). This expectation is even further diminished in cases in which police have killed social activists in the course of upholding or defending the state capitalist status quo. Clearly in such cases the officers are carrying out their fundamental purpose of maintaining dominant structures of social stratification and hegemonic order. And in this they must be assured full protection and legitimation. Thus it is almost certain that they will not be taken to task under such circumstances for killing someone who challenges that order or threatens to make a public show of reasonable opposition to established order.</p>
<p>The official investigation into the RCMP officers who killed Indigenous Anonymous activist James McIntyre while he was protesting the Site C dam megaproject in British Columbia and the conclusions drawn by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) is in no way surprising then. The IIO exonerated the officers involved including the cop who fired the shot that killed James McIntyre despite the fact that the officer failed even to file an internal report on the killing which is required under law. The IIO could only state with futility:</p>
<p>“As of the time this decision is being issued, it does not appear that the subject officer has completed any reports or notes of his recollection of the incident. The IIO has, and continues to engage with the RCMP on the necessity of officers completing timely reports.” (IIO 2016)</p>
<p>Adds the IIO spokesperson Marten Youssef: “They are required to write timely reports, timely accounts, detailing their account of what happened. It appears as of the time of writing this case that the subject officer in this investigation did not comply with that policy.” (quoted in Kurjata 2016)</p>
<p>And there is nothing to suggest that the killer cop received so much as a stern word or cross look for this violation, let alone any sort of actual punishment. Yet the IIO concludes that the officer did nothing wrong despite the absence of any report.</p>
<p>The failure of officers involved in the killing of civilians to file reports of to file reports in a timely manner is notorious in British Columbia, a fact the IIO has raised repeatedly. Indeed officers often watch media coverage before filing a report in those cases where a report is actually provided. Clearly police in the province view the legal requirements under which they are supposed to operate as something of a joke or at most a matter of personal convenience rather than a legal requirement of their job. As in other cases the officers view themselves as above the law—they are a law unto themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore there is no mechanism to compel officers to interview with the IIO in the course of its investigation. That is, officers choose whether or not they will interview with the supposedly independent investigation. One can well guess the choice killer cops tend to make. So in the case of the RCMP killing of James McIntyre the IIO had no interview testimony from the officer responsible for killing McIntyre.</p>
<p>Notably witnesses interviewed by the IIO varied in their accounts of how James McIntyre responded to police (approached, lunged, jabbing, coming towards, etc.). They were inconsistent in portraying the threat, if any, that the victim posed. There is no sense that James McIntyre posed a threat beyond police to the public. In addition the witnesses do make clear that James McIntyre was shot almost immediately as police told him to drop his knife (which some witnesses suggested was described as a “weapon” rather than a knife by police). Some witnesses noted having unreliable sight lines. One witness noted not being able to see after being hit by pepper spray from police (and before the fatal shot was fired). A witness officer admits that McIntyre only became agitated <em>after</em> being pepper sprayed. Yet the IIO somehow concluded that the officers did nothing to provoke McIntyre. Despite all of this the IIO wrapped their investigation and exonerated the officer, who remains unnamed.</p>
<p>Police did not even know until afterwards that McIntyre was not the man they had received a call about a protester at an event promoting the Site C project. That man was local farmer Terry Hadland. Hadland described his reasons for ripping up maps and turning over tables at the event: “I triggered the whole darn thing because I didn’t want Hydro to get away with smooching up to the public” (quoted in Kurjata 2016). He was deeply impacted by the police actions that killed James McIntyre. In his words:  “Oh, I was devastated. I felt awfully guilty. I could hardly believe that…it was surreal, especially as I began to realize it was me they were out for” (quoted in Kurjata 2016).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what response Anonymous might have to the conclusion of the IIO investigation. The <em>National Post</em> reports their interview with an Anonymous activist previously. The activist is quoted as saying there would be retaliation in the event of a cover up:</p>
<p>“Our message to whoever will be making those kind of decisions (is) that we are a very talented and patient and courageous crew and even if it takes us many months or many years to figure out what went wrong, we will sniff out your dirtiest laundry, procure it from wherever it’s hiding and find the highest flagpole in the windiest part of the public square and hang it up for everyone to smell and everyone to see.” (quoted in Humphreys 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not a cover up, the IIO investigation certainly leaves important questions unanswered. While raising many others.</p>

<p>The first decades of the twenty-first century have seen new strategies and tactics of social resistance and activism. Among these have been the largely online actions of groupings like Anonymous, a decentered manifestation of people using online strategies and tactics to confront real world injustices. A global phenomenon Anonymous has inspired and involved activists in the Canadian context as well. While Anonymous is viewed as an online grouping its members live and organize in specific locales where they are active in their communities working on issues of social and environmental justice. And it is in such locales that some have been killed by police and security forces. Such was the case of James McIntyre, a 48 year-old man shot and killed by RCMP, an Anonymous activist who was protesting a destructive BC Hydro megaproject, the Site C Dam. Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, a popular mask worn during protests, McIntyre, who worked as a dishwasher at a local restaurant in Dawson Creek, was claimed by Anonymous as a comrade. In response to McIntyre’s killing the online activists promised actions against the RCMP and the agency’s national website went down on Sunday, July 19.</p>
<p>McIntyre, a Métis man, who expressed concern for the land and opposition to destructive development projects was described by his cousin Keith LaRiviere as sharing a deep concern for “the soil and our ancestral values” (Trumpener 2016a). McIntyre was opposed to the Site C dam project which is understood by Indigenous communities to be an assault on the land as well as a destroyer of culture and a threat to communities. For McIntyre, as for many activists, the project is simply another example of state and business acting in pursuit of shared interests in profit against the health and wellbeing of nature and Indigenous communities. According to LaRiviere, McIntyre was worried impact of the Site C dam on local Indigenous communities and landowners (Trumpener 2016a).</p>
<p>This killing by RCMP occurred in a twenty-first century context in which much concern has been raised about police violence and repression against protesters, particularly those who oppose environmentally harmful projects. Earlier in 2015 the Canadian government passed new legislation giving police institutions increased powers under a rubric of “anti-terrorism.” This is also a context of growing mobilization, organizing, and activism against ongoing colonialism and for Indigenous sovereignty and against ecological crisis and climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Killing of James McIntyre</p>
<p>On Thursday, July 15, 2015 RCMP officers in Dawson Creek, B.C. shot and killed a man, later identified as James Daniel McIntyre. McIntyre was killed while standing outside of a local restaurant, the Fixx Urban Grill, where a BC Hydro open house on the contentious Site C dam project was being held. Police were responding to calls about disruptive behavior involving another man but encountered McIntyre instead, shooting him after minimal engagement. The incident was at least partly recorded by a witness, Mike Irmen.</p>
<p>Initial reports suggested James McIntyre was wearing a Guy Fawkes mask at the time he was shot. The Guy Fawkes mask (representing the English rebel involved in a plot to blow up parliament) has become a popular and recognizable symbol of protest, particularly as the public symbol of hacktivist grouping Anonymous. The mask has been adopted by activists since its appearance in the popular film <em>V for Vendetta</em> a futuristic, dystopian movie about anti-corporate activism based on the graphic novel of the same title penned by the anarchist Allan Moore. Curiously, McIntyre’s sister, Wanda McIntyre suggested afterward that her brother disliked wearing masks. In her recollection: “He didn’t really like masks. Maybe that’s one of the reasons he didn&#8217;t pursue his welding (career), just that claustrophobia of having something on your face. I know that he had a mask that I ordered for him [a Phantom of the Opera Halloween costume]. That’s the only mask I knew he had” (quoted in Wakefield 2016). While there has been no formal confirmation, witness accounts suggested the mask was a Guy Fawkes mask and this would fit with McIntyre’s identification with Anonymous.</p>
<p>Before the protest James McIntyre tweeted from his twitter account @jaymack9:</p>
<p>“Ready 4 our little showdown? Our people r going 2 b in place at that meeting in Dawson Creek(BC Hydro).”</p>
<p>— jay mack (@jaymack9) July 16, 2015</p>
<p>As in other cases, police first gave priority to restraining McIntyre in handcuffs, as he lay dying, rather than offer any medical assistance.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office initially reported, apparently following police, that the man who caused the disturbance at the Site C dam event was McIntyre. Yet it was afterward revealed that McIntyre was not the man who caused the disturbance that apparently led to police being called in the first place. It appears too that police had a mistaken assumption about McIntyre when they encountered him, believing him to be the person who had acted out during the event in the restaurant. This sort of misidentification is a common occurrence in many cases of police causing harm to civilians leading officers to believe someone poses a threat they do not pose and reacting with higher levels of aggression or violence. There is an assumption in such cases that force must be deployed immediately and police act in a prejudicial way in confronting a non-threatening victim.</p>
<p>No further details have been given or clarification offered regarding what threat, if any McIntyre might have posed. For example, it is not clear why, if he posed a threat, no one viewed it as serious enough to point out beforehand or to contact police, while police were contacted simply for someone being loud and apparently wrecking some displays at the meeting. No details have been provided publicly even to clarify how police came to target McIntyre or what led matters to move quickly to a killing by police.</p>
<p>Police claim they took appropriate steps to de-escalate the encounter. Yet witnesses reported hearing only screaming by police and suggested the encounter was fairly brief before police shot the victim.</p>
<p>There has been no independent confirmation that McIntyre carried or displayed an actual knife at the time police encountered him. The IIO did conclude that a knife was at the scene but did not confirm its connection to James McIntyre. Nor has there been any information provided publicly by police or witnesses to suggest that if McIntyre had a knife he used it in a threatening manner toward police or moved in a threatening way toward the officers.</p>
<p>The man who actually disrupted the Site C event later came forward as Terry Hadland, a Peace Valley wheat farmer who has opposed Site C for decades. He reported that he did not know McIntyre and had not even met the young man prior to the event at Fixx Urban Grill. Yet he now feels a debt to the young man killed in a police intervention meant for him. According to Hadland: “(McIntyre) created a diversion so I could get away. He stepped up and took that shot for me, that&#8217;s for sure” (quoted in Wakefield 2016). A terrible and stark realization. And why should anyone be executed by police simply for protesting environmental harm and destruction and in defense of land and communities?</p>
<p>A year after the RCMP killing of James McIntyre and the initiation of the IIO investigation, Terry Hadland says he has never been interviewed by investigators from any service. With disbelief he says: “They have never gotten ahold of me. No, never” (quoted in Trumpener 2016b). Hadland finds this particularly strange given that his actions in tearing up maps and tipping tables triggered the call to RCMP that would result in McIntyre’s killing. In Hadland’s account: “I triggered the whole darn thing because I didn’t want Hydro to get away with smooching up to the public” (quoted in Trumpener 2016b).</p>
<p>After being escorted from the meeting Hadland reported getting in his care and driving directly home. He only heard about the killing the following day. The news hit him hard. In his recollection: “Oh, I was devastated. I felt awfully guilty. I could hardly believe that … it was surreal, especially as I began to realize it was me they were out for” (quoted in Trumpener 2016b).</p>
<p>The lack of any interview with Hadland was not for his lack of trying to provide one. Upon hearing of the killing of McIntyre Hadland says he immediately rushed over to the Dawson Creek RCMP Detachment and spoke with an officer for around 20 minutes (Trumpener 2016b). In his telling: “I said, ‘look it, you guys have been duped, because I didn’t do anything down there for you to go down there and shoot somebody” (quoted in Trumpener 2016b).</p>
<p>Incredibly the police wanted to hear none of what he had to say. He remembers vividly that the police “patted me on the back and sent me home” (quoted in Trumpener 2016b). Police tried to present McIntyre, who had given some cover to Hadland as a threat to him. In classic fear panic language RCMP claimed: “It’s a good thing you were there because maybe this guy was really dangerous. And if you hadn’t been there, and a 911 call made, maybe something else would have happened” (quoted in Trumpener 2016b). This is a revealing commentary and it shows the “us versus them” view of the world in which everyone is a dangerous threat or a victim that so strictly frames police perspectives and impels their often lethal actions.</p>
<p>Terry Hadland still has no idea why he has been neither charged for his actions that evening nor interviewed despite his efforts to have his account heard. He says: “I haven’t heard a word. The investigation, I don’t think it can be thorough until they have spoken to me, and they haven’t” (quoted in Trumpener 2016b).</p>
<p>The long-time Site C opponent, who describes himself as a technically challenged old farmer says he has had no association with Anonymous and did not know McIntyre. Sadly, he acknowledges: “But we are now linked forever, he and I” (quoted in Trumpener 2016).</p>
<p>While still under investigation by the IIO for killing McIntyre, the RCMP undertook a separate investigation of McIntyre. They searched his apartment and seized a variety of personal items. For some reason these included model trains according to Veronica McIntyre. The RCMP E Division did not provide any comment on the status of that investigation in response to inquiries from journalists.</p>
<p>Another Anonymous tweet, from Anarcho Anon, on the Saturday following McIntyre’s killing reported that the apartment at which his family lived was raided by police following the shooting. Police claimed that that raid was unrelated. They offered no explanation about why the raid was carried out so close in time to the killing of James McIntyre or what it involved.</p>
<p>The IIO has refused to identify the officers involved in the shooting. Unlike cases of police killings of civilians in the United States, in the Canadian state context police officers who kill are rarely, if ever, identified publicly. Only in cases in which charges are formally brought by the Crown, which are also extremely rare, will officers be named. This is an issue that critics of police brutality and advocates for greater accountability have long raised.</p>
<p>IIO spokesperson Kellie Kilpatrick has stated that the IIO has not dealt with a case with “as many moving parts and changing landscapes as this one” (quoted in Bein 2015). Kilpatrick suggests that the shooting of James McIntyre is one of the most difficult cases the IIO has ever examined. In her words: “This is the first time that we’ve had such a significant change in the information we’re reporting” (quoted in Baluja 2015). Yet apart from the facts of misinformation from police about McIntyre’s conduct at the event and the misidentification of another person who was the actual reason police were called to the scene, Kilpatrick has not said why the case is so difficult.</p>
<p>The officer who shot McIntyre was reportedly assigned to administrative duties, returning to active duty after a period of six months. An April 7 letter from the Ministry of Public Safety that appeared in a Dawson Creek city council agenda noted that three officers took off-duty sick leave after the shooting Wakefield 2015). The Dawson City RCMP has a total of 25 members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Climate Change Disaster and Threat to Indigenous Communities: Site C</p>
<p>The Site C dam project is a BC Hydro megaproject planned for development in the Peace River Valley in northeastern British Columbia. The proposed 60 meter high mega dam at Site C would flood more than 100 km of the river valley. In addition to the obvious immediate impacts of flooding critics point to the risks of landslides as banks of the reservoir erode with the passage of time. The Site C dam would be the third dam in the valley, added to two existing dams on the Peace River. A major investment for industrial capital the Site C dam project is valued at $8.8 billion.</p>
<p>The Peace River Valley is the home of Treaty 8 First Nations, their hunting, fishing, and trapping grounds. The area is one of the most significant wildlife corridors in the migration corridor from Yellowstone to Yukon (Wilderness Committee n.d.). It is also the site of important old growth boreal forests. The development of the Site C project represents a direct threat, an assault really, on Indigenous communities, cultures, lives, and survival.</p>
<p>The land under threat of flooding is also among the most important agricultural land in northern British Columbia. It is noted for having the only class one soil north of Quesnel (Wilderness Committee n.d.). Many farms will be destroyed if the project goes through. The destruction of such significant agricultural land has raised serious concerns in a period of growing encroachment on agricultural lands. This concern is added to broader concerns about food security particularly for Indigenous communities, and given the destruction of wildlife habitat and food sources on which Indigenous people rely. The project will also submerge valuable carbon sinks (Wilderness Committee n.d.). Mainstream environmentalist David Suzuki has identified the Site C project as a climate change disaster (quoted in Prystupo 2016).</p>
<p>The British Columbia Liberal government claims that it needs the energy provided by Site C to meet provincial needs. Yet this is a political claim. The needs being met are not those of local or provincial residents (regular individual civilians) but rather the desires of multinational capital in the province. In particular the project is about meeting the energy demands of extractives industries, the oil, gas, and mining companies. BC Hydro reports conclude that current demands can be met through energy conservation. Attention can also be given to alternative energy forms. Site C is a public subsidy to the extractives companies. As the Wilderness Committee puts it: “It’s an $8 billion taxpayer subsidy to a dirty fossil fuel industry that needs cheap energy to expand” (n.d.). Incredibly, the federal/provincial Joint Review Panel found that not only was the need for the electricity to be generated by the project not clearly demonstrated but the alternatives to the project had not been assessed. Critics suggest that they were not even considered because the interest is not in meeting residential demands but rather is solely concerned with industrial demands of corporations.</p>
<p>Site C was granted environmental assessment approval by the governments of British Columbia and Canada on October 14, 2014. This despite the fact that the Joint Review Panel concluded that Site C would cause irreparable damage to local First Nations communities and fish and wildlife populations (Wilderness Committee n.d.). The BC Liberal government approved construction of the dam on December 16, 2014.</p>
<p>As the prospects of legal challenges from multiple constituencies arose the Premier of British Columbia Christy Clark stated, in anti-democratic fashion, her intention to get construction on the dam “to the point of no return” before a political election in May 2017 could lead to a change in government and possible repeal of the project. BC Hydro has estimated that by the time of the election around $4 billion of construction contracts will be locked in place (Hunter 2016). As of September 2016, construction has moved well along despite opposition.</p>
<p>Scholars and scientists have also raised grave concerns about the Site C project, in terms of environmental impacts and in terms of government obligations to seek and achieve informed consent from Indigenous communities prior to any possible development and to meet Treaty obligations more broadly. In May of 2016 more than 200 high profile Canadian scholars signed a letter expressing their deep concerns about the Site C approval process. The elite Royal Society of Canada wrote a separate letter directly to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calling on the federal government to halt construction on the project. The letter from “Concerned Scientists” outlined their intersecting concerns in the following language: “Our assessment is that this process did not accord with the commitments of both the provincial and federal governments to reconciliation with and legal obligations to First Nations, protection of the environment, and evidence-based decision-making with scientific integrity” (quoted in Cheadle 2016). The federal government rejected the appeal and the Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna announced that the government had “no intention to revisit the Site C environmental assessment” (quoted in McCarthy 2016).</p>
<p>The Treaty 8 First Nations from the Peace River Region are actively and courageously opposing the Site C project. They are defending their communities, cultures, land, and Treaty rights against interests of major multinational capital, local corporations, and provincial and federal governments in Canada. In April of 2016 BC Treaty 8 First Nations filed a legal challenge to the project with the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Both the BC Treaty 8 First Nations and the Peace Valley Landowners’ Association have undertaken legal challenges to the project in the federal court of Canada. BC Hydro attempted to have these cases expedited to allow them to continue on their 2016 construction schedule. The court dismissed their request. Court challenges are also being brought by Alberta Treaty 8 First Nations. The Blueberry River First Nation has brought forward a “sweeping challenge” which gets to the heart of Canadian state and Indigenous relations in Canada. Their case cites “a century of broken treaty promises to be able to continue practicing their traditions on the land” (quoted in Gillis 2015).</p>
<p>These are some of the stakes in this important twenty-first century struggle. The battles over Site C raise current issues of colonialism and decolonization, land claims, Indigenous sovereignty, ecological integrity and climate change, and social justice. These are the issues that motivated James McIntyre to oppose the Site C project and to take an active stand in doing so. Inevitably these are the struggles that he put his life on the line for. In the support of government and corporate interests and against Indigenous, social, and ecological justice the RCMP were willing to kill. And did kill.</p>
<p>Keith LaRiviere has continued to act and speak out against the Site C dam since his cousin’s killing. LaRiviere has participated in protest events such as the Paddle for Peace, a canoe demonstration against Site C in 2016. And this matters to him, not only for James but for the land and community. In his view: “It’s not just a family issue, this is an environmental issue” (quoted in Trumpener 2016a). And it is an issue that has galvanized broad support in defense of the land and communities and against Site C. Against the community opposition the supporters of Site C are largely the state and capital.</p>
<p>This is a message that James McIntyre was working to get out. The RCMP silenced that particular voice but the message continues as has community organizing against Site C. As LaRiviere suggests: “He was worried about the Peace country being destroyed by another dirty project. If that’s Jim’s message, don’t stifle his voice” (quoted in Trumpener 2016a).</p>
<p>In response to the killing of McIntyre, BC Hydro postponed several scheduled job fairs for Site C that were to have been held in northern British Columbia that month. The postponed job fairs were scheduled for the communities of Chetwynd, Fort St. John, and Tumbler Ridge. They also said they would review their policies and procedures around public meetings. In public statement BC Hydro announced: “BC Hydro is currently evaluating its policies and procedures for public meetings. The postponement of the job fairs will give us time to complete this task…Our intent is to ensure the safety of our staff and members of the public” (quoted in CBC News 2015b). This move was viewed by many commentators and opponents of Site C alike really as a measure to keep opponents out and critical voices from being heard.</p>
<p>A moderate environmental group, the Wilderness Committee, also decided to cancel a protest planned for the week McIntyre was killed outside of BC Hydro’s Vancouver offices. This was a strange choice given that McIntyre was killed opposing a project the Wilderness Committee also opposes. A better option might have been to protest at an RCMP detachment in the Metro Vancouver area. That would have honored McIntyre’s commitment and sacrifice.</p>

<p>On Anonymity</p>
<p>Anonymity has become a marker of modern life in industrial capitalist society and the mass politics of liberal democracy. Anonymity is built right into the key structures and institutions of everyday life in modern capitalism. In work, people are anonymous producers playing a part that is often indistinct, general, replaceable, lacking the uniqueness of skilled, artisanal work. This is an aspect of the alienation from labor that Marx so famously addresses.</p>
<p>In politics, mass democracy renders political action, by definition, an anonymous, nameless, unidentifiable, indistinct activity behind a screen at a ballot box every four or five years. The political actor, rendered as a voter, is further made anonymous between elections in the mass regurgitation of incessant, nameless poll results.</p>
<p>In the urbanity of capitalist life, which has now, for the first time in human history, compelled most people on the planet to live in cities, residents live in close proximity to people they do not know, who do not know them, and experience literally thousands of anonymous interactions with people every year, from buying a newspaper, to getting on the bus, to attending a concert, to simply passing in the street.</p>
<p>Anonymity finds perhaps its most idiomatic or iconic moment in time spent online in which people can post intense, intimate feelings or thoughts in forms, such as online comments, twitter, or websites and blogs, which are strictly anonymous.</p>
<p>It is perhaps characteristic of the age and social structure of contemporary capitalism then that activism has taken the form of anonymity and the anonymous. Indeed, perhaps the most striking political formation or manifestation online is quite literally known as Anonymous. This makes sense both because the internet allows for anonymity but is also representative of the surveillance powers of the capitalist state and corporations that seek to destroy anonymity and name and identify anyone who goes against the state capitalist consensus of accumulation, exploitation, and compliance. Anonymity offers the activist the mask of secrecy and privacy that the state is so determined to deny.</p>
<p>Anonymous is the name of a decentered, loose affinity group of online activists and hackers. Their decentered nature means they are largely formless and structureless. As communications scholar and McGill University Professor Gabriella Coleman suggests: “Anonymous is a little bit hard to define, because it’s a collective name that anyone around the world can take” (quoted in Early Edition 2015).  They share mostly an action orientation and an identity, important narrative practices, and symbolism. It is a banner that can be adopted by diverse users as needs and circumstances arise (Shantz and Tomblin 2014).</p>
<p>By their nature in being an anonymous grouping that seeks privacy and avoidance of security their members are largely unknown, nameless, unidentifiable. Gabriella Coleman suggests that what is known of the demographics of the grouping places most of its members as youth between the ages of 15 and 35. Much of the demographic information known about Anonymous comes from those members who have been arrested. Thus, that information might say more about the people who are caught than about the broader participant group.</p>
<p>Anonymous provided James McIntyre an ideal expression for political action. It reflected his introverted nature and love of privacy. It reflected his preference of being alone, unidentified, rather than being a public figure or socially recognized. Keith LaRiviere identified his cousin’s major characteristics as “isolation and [a] huge brain” (quoted in Trumpener 2016a). This, it would seem are major characteristics of many who find affinity with, and/or act on behalf of, Anonymous. For LaRiviere: “Making a statement with that mask makes all the sense in the world to me for Jim, because he was alone in his life,” (quoted in Trumpener 2016a).</p>
<p>Anonymous activists approach activism through a mix of new and old tactics from denial of service attacks and hacks to whistleblowing or public shaming.  Coleman notes that Anonymous was initially known primarily as a prankster grouping gaining notoriety for internet pranks. Since 2008 they have turned to direct action and political campaigns, projects, and interventions. Among the issues they have become known for taking involve state or corporate intrusion on privacy, issues of censorship, opposition to surveillance, and matters of free speech.</p>
<p>With the emergence of Black Lives Matter and movements against police brutality since the police killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, the group has actively supported civilians opposing police violence. Operation Ferguson provided support for protesters speaking out and mobilizing against the racist policing practices of the Ferguson force that killed Michael Brown. They have worked to see the names of officers involved in the killing of civilians released publicly. They have also brought attention on disruptive and interfering police officials and police association representatives who have operated to shield police who kill civilians or who eek to blame the victims. Since Ferguson this work has continued in cases involving police harm to civilians in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>In terms of activism Anonymous has been most well-known for DDOS, or distributed denial of service, attacks in which overwhelming traffic is directed to a target website causing the server to shut down. The site becomes inaccessible. This is a way to shut down an offending institution’s online venues and potentially cost money, supporters, and/or sponsors. Anonymous has also publicized confidential documents and publicized information in a form of whistleblowing to the public (Shantz and Tomblin 2014).</p>
<p>More recently the group has turned to doxing. This practice has been used to “out” offending individuals by releasing their names and private information such as phone numbers or home addresses. This particular tactic has been used in cases of police violence to name relevant officers involved. Anonymous usually follows through on its threats in cases like the policing killing of James McIntyre. Although it might be noted that the impact is usually one of publicity or shaming more than severe consequences for government or corporations. As Coleman suggests: “They don’t usually make a call and then do nothing. Many times they will exaggerate what they will do” (quoted in Early Edition 2015). In Coleman’s assessment, in a case like this the most credible and impactful threat would likely be doxing.</p>
<p>In one particularly significant action against Canadian government and security forces Anonymous took responsibility for shutting down the websites of the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS), the Canadian government’s spy agency, in an appeal for Canadians to oppose Bill C-51 in 2015. C-51 is a repressive piece of legislation that became law as the Anti-Terror Act of 2015. It contains provisions that give CSIS investigative powers, allow for the criminalization of so-called bad thoughts only (rather than terrorist actions), and allows for the criminalization of economic activity such as strikes, boycotts, or blockades. It also extends possibilities for criminalization of protests, particularly those against energy projects. The law also gives police additional powers to arrest people pre-emptively.</p>
<p>While primarily viewed as an online phenomenon, every once in a while we are reminded that any activism also occurs in the real, material world where all activists must live, work, love, and play. This fact is violently reinforced when, as in James McIntyre’s case, an Anonymous member is killed by a security force. After the RCMP killing of James McIntyre, Anonymous claimed that McIntyre was the fourth of its members to be killed by security forces around the world in four years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Anonymous Life</p>
<p>McIntyre’s friends and family described him as a gentle, quiet man who did not interact much with people directly. He was said to be quite intelligent and thoughtful. McIntyre was said to be very close with his family regularly attending family gatherings. He had only moved out and into his own apartment a few years before police killed him. Even then, a devoted son and family member, McIntyre rented his apartment a floor above his mother’s apartment. McIntyre’s mom, Veronica, said he often talked about the Site C project which greatly troubled him.</p>
<p>James McIntyre was raised along with four siblings by Veronica, a single mother. He spent his early years in the Dawson Creek area attending elementary school in Pouce Coupe and Central Middle School in Dawson Creek. The family moved to Grande Prairie, Alberta where McIntyre graduated from St. Joseph Catholic High. Following high school James joined his brothers in the trades, working several years as a welder primarily at mills in northern British Columbia and Alberta. (Wakefield 2016). McIntyre returned to Dawson Creek in 2008. He worked at Chances Casino and Le’s Family Restaurant.</p>
<p>An afficionado of model trains from an early age, McIntyre used the internet to connect with model train enthusiasts from all over. In the words of his sister Wanda McIntyre: “He was train crazy. His apartment was kind of small so he couldn’t have a big layout. He got a computer I think probably for the train aspect” (quoted in Wakefield 2016). His interest in model trains and use of online media to discuss them may have opened new venues for his broader interests in environment and land.</p>
<p>Unassuming and a dedicated worker, McIntyre had received notice in the local newspapers only once, for winning an employee award for his work as a dishwasher, before his sensational killing by police garnered international media attention. McIntyre worked as a dishwasher at a local restaurant and casino and apparently loved the job as it afforded him time to himself away from the attentions of others.</p>
<p>Family described McIntyre as “straight edge,” eschewing smokes, drugs, and alcohol. According to his cousin Keith LaRiviere: “He didn’t go out and play. He didn’t join the baseball team with us. He didn’t drink. He didn’t have a girlfriend. He didn’t drive a car. He wouldn’t cross the road except at a crosswalk. He was soft” (quoted in Trumpener 2016a). McIntyre was a hard worker who saved his money largely to attend model train conventions, attending events in Prince George, Berkeley, California, and Reno, Nevada (Wakefield 2016). The owner of Le’s Family Restaurant, Le Nguyen described McIntyre as a “normal guy” (quoted in Wakefield 2016).</p>
<p>Committed to environmental care, McIntyre developed his own recycling program to sort bottles and cans at work in the absence of an employer developed program. McIntyre recycled the materials at Chances Casino taking them to bins outside a Walmart near the casino. According to his sister Wanda McIntyre: &#8220;He was very much an environmentalist, he was always trying to recycle and do stuff like that, but he wasn’t an extremist. I don’t know how he even found out about it, whether he knew someone who was into it and brought him into the fold, I had no idea. He never talked about it to me” (quoted in Wakefield 2016). His mother shared this perspective. She knew her son was concerned about the environment but did not speak with him about how and why he came to be actively concerned about the Site C project specifically. In her recollection: “I don’t know why he got involved with that Site C dam. He was concerned about that. I guess it was just the environment, and he felt for the people there. (That&#8217;s) why he voiced his opinion” (quoted in Wakefield 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anonymous Responds</p>
<p>Anonymous identified McIntyre as a “fallen comrade.” The response by Anonymous to the police killing of James McIntyre was named “Operation Anon Down” and was designed to achieve “justice (and vengeance if necessary) for our fallen comrade in Dawson Creek” (Early Edition 2015). They released statements calling for accountability for the officers involved. They tweeted messages directly to the RCMP.</p>
<p>“Ohai @rcmpgrcpolice we would like to report a murder of one of our comrades by some of your officers. Shall we expect justice or cover up?</p>
<p>7:45 PM &#8211; 17 Jul 2015”</p>
<p>The Anonymous statement after the killing of James McIntyre went further:</p>
<p>“In their statement, Anonymous also said that “an RCMP officer mercilessly shot and killed a masked anon without provocation or cause,” and “if Canadian police were as brave as Canadian nurses they could deal with people with knives without hiding behind bullets.”</p>
<p>“We will most certainly avenge our own,” the group said, adding that they will also fundraise to cover the costs of the burial of their fallen comrade.</p>
<p>“If we do not receive justice, rest assured there will be revenge,” they said. “Behind this mask is an idea, and ideas are bullet-proof.” (Bein 2015)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to the RCMP killing of James McIntyre, Anonymous called on people to protest at RCMP headquarters in every province. The day after Anonymous released a statement on McIntyre’s killing, the RCMP’s national website was shut down for several hours. RCMP sites in British Columbia and Dawson Creek also crashed on the Sunday following McIntyre’s killing (CBC 2015a).</p>
<p>Then Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said the threats were taken seriously but offered little insight into the government response. In a public statement he offered this platitude on passive democracy: “There are many ways this country enjoys freedom to express our democratic views. I invite those who want to express their views to use democratic ways. Those who don&#8217;t expose themselves to face the full force of the law” (quoted in Kane 2015). The government said it would leave matters of investigation to the Independent Investigations Office, a strange response since that agency only looks into harms caused to civilians by police. It has no mandate to investigate perceived threats to government websites.</p>
<p>Indeed, the RCMP did carry out some investigation into social media activities of Anonymous following their threats on the RCMP website. Minister Blaney did note that the government viewed security issues as a priority and dedicated funding to work with capital (private businesses) to target electronic threats. This made clear the role of government in acting as a security service for capital (at working class taxpayer expense). For the government, according to Blaney: “We are constantly monitoring cyber security and cyberattacks” (quoted in Kane 2015).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion: The Death of Truth</p>
<p>According to Keith LaRiviere: “Jim didn’t deserve to die in a brutal manner. The man lying on the ground was not a criminal. He was a victim of police violence” (quoted in Trumpener 2016a). Wanda McIntrye cannot say what the family would hope to get from any investigation into her brother’s killing. Regardless of the investigation’s outcome, her brother will still be as dead. In her words: “We’re still in shock. I guess the outcome is what the outcome is, whatever we say or do. It’s not going to change the fact” (quoted in Wakefield 2016).</p>
<p>Dawson Creek Mayor Dale Bumstead appears to share the perspective that this killing did not need to happen. In his words” Somebody lost their life yesterday, senselessly in my view, and I just hate the fact that it happened in my community” (quoted in Baluja 2015). People in British Columbia have long raised questions about the disproportionate use of lethal force by police, RCMP in particular, in small towns and especially small northern towns.</p>
<p>The details of his killing by police, as is typically the case with regard to police killings of civilians in Canada, will likely not come out publicly. As James McIntyre’s cousin Keith LaRiviere is left to conclude: “The truth is with Jim. The truth is with a dead man” (quoted in Trumpener 2016a). Wanda McIntyre is left with a similar feeling. In her view: “There’s no answers, and the only person with the answers is gone” (quoted in Wakefield 2016).</p>
<p>While appreciating the sentiment involved, that is not entirely true. RCMP officers involved in the shooting, and certainly those who killed James McIntyre, surely have some answers as to what happened that night in Dawson Creek. But, as is typical in the Canadian context when police kill civilians, the police are not required to provide those answers and there are virtually no mechanisms for a thorough, truthful reporting of events anyway.</p>

<p>On Thursday, July 16, 2015 RCMP officers in Dawson Creek, B.C. shot and killed a man, later identified as James Daniel McIntyre (48). McIntyre was killed while standing outside of a local restaurant where a BC Hydro open house on the contentious Site C dam project was being held. Police were responding to calls about disruptive behavior involving another man but encountered McIntyre instead, shooting him after minimal engagement. The incident was at least partly recorded by a witness, Mike Irmen. Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, a popular mask worn during protests, McIntrye, who worked as a dishwasher at another local restaurant in Dawson Creek, has been claimed by Anonymous as a comrade. In response to McIntyre’s killing the online activists promised actions against the RCMP and the agency’s national website went down on Sunday, July 19.</p>
<p>This killing by RCMP has occurred in a context in which much concern has been raised about police violence and repression against protesters, particularly those who oppose environmentally harmful projects. Earlier in 2015 the Canadian government passed new legislation giving police institutions increased powers under a rubric of “anti-terrorism.”</p>
",Deadly Force (2018),
0086-V1,"A woman called 911 after her estranged husband, Kenneth Robert Hanna, broke into her home carrying a rifle with a mounted bayonet. According to news reports, police confronted Hanna inside the home and shot him twice in the chest when he pointed his rifle at officers. Simultaneously, Hanna turned his rifle and shot himself in the head. Police found the body of his ex-wife's boyfriend in the home. He had been shot to death by Hanna.",Deadly Force (2018),
0087-V1,"Hudson Daryl Willis Brooks was shot and killed by police outside a community policing station. News reports said Brooks was acting erratically while walking down a street, and neighbours reported hearing screaming followed by gunshots. Although an independent investigation has been completed, information on the incident is limited because the Crown has laid charges. An RCMP officer has pleaded not guilty to aggravated assault and assault with a weapon.; Hudson Daryl Willis Brooks was shot and killed by police outside a community policing station. News reports said Brooks was acting erratically while walking down a street, and neighbours reported hearing screaming followed by gunshots. An RCMP officer was charged with aggrivated assault and assault with a weapon in the death. Prosecutors dropped the case two years later.
<p>When it comes to police killings of civilians, the state protects the state. This is not surprising given that police are the force of brute violence (the state’s monopoly on violence) which always accompanies and underpins the state’s legislative (ideological) face. Law and force go hand in hand.</p>
<p>On July 18, 2015, RCMP Constable Elizabeth Cucheran shot 20-year-old Hudson Brooks nine times outside the RCMP detachment in South Surrey, killing him. The Constable fired a dozen times at the youth, who was shirtless and shoeless and in some mental health distress. On September 18, 2019, more than four years later, the British Columbia prosecution service announced that charges of aggravated assault and assault with a weapon had been stayed against Constable Cucheran.</p>
<p>That the killer cop did not even face charges of murder or manslaughter for shooting an unarmed youth nine times and that it took more than four years to reach this decision shows the special manner with which police who kill are treated by the state in Canada.</p>
<p>Even more, in announcing their the prosecution service chose to emphasize that “<a href=""https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/charges-stayed-against-rcmp-officer-who-killed-man-in-surrey-b-c"">the law is clear that even the mistaken belief in the need to use lethal force is a complete defence</a>.” Killer cops always have this excuse, no matter how unjustified, ludicrous, or unsubstantiated, at their ready disposal. It is all they ever need to kill when they want, under whatever conditions they themselves alone decide. Police define the circumstances and they define reasonableness. Even if they are mistaken or lying. Few prosecutors, who depend on police for their cases (and who also uphold the state as do police), will ever challenge them. It is literally a license to kill.</p>
<p>This case earlier showed as well the way in which police lie after they kill someone to suggest that the victim posed a greater threat than they did. To blame the victim. Initial RCMP statements suggested that there had been an exchange of gunfire and an officer was also shot. This gave a public impression that Brooks had been armed and there had been some sort of gunfight between the victim and officers. It was later revealed that Constable Cucheran, in a lethal panic, had shot herself among the 12 shots she fired.</p>

<p>RCMP Constable Elizabeth Cucheran has been charged with aggravated assault and assault with a weapon in the killing of Hudson Brooks on July 18, 2015 in Surrey, British Columbia, a rare case of a killer cop being charged in Canada. On January 9, 2018, Constable Cucheran pleaded not guilty to both charges. The officer’s lawyer Andrea Kastanis entered the not guilty pleas on Cucheran’s behalf as Cucheran did not attend provincial court in Surrey, Interestingly, Kastanis also informed the court that Cucheran has elected to be tried by judge and jury rather than judge alone. The next step court dates will involve a preliminary inquiry now scheduled  take place over eight days in November and December of 2018.</p>
<p>No members of the Brooks family attended court on January 9, saying they will wait for the trial to start. The family has organized a number of events and started a campaign calling for Justice for Hudson since their loved one was shot and killed outside an RCMP detachment in South Surrey in 2015. They had a very long wait with little information about the killing of Hudson Brooks. Cucheran was only charged at the end of 2017, nearly two and a half years after Brooks died.</p>
<p>The RCMP has placed Cucheran on administrative duties. The force had initially suggested publicly that Brooks had a weapon as an officer was shot during the killing. It turns out that only police service weapons were present at the scene and that would was inflicted by the RCMP themselves.</p>

<p>RCMP Constable Elizabeth Cucheran has been charged with one count of aggravated assault and one count of assault with a weapon in the 2015 killing of 20-year-old Hudson Brooks in Surrey, British Columbia. Brooks was shot by RCMP and killed outside the District 5 RCMP detachment on 152 Street in south Surrey at around 2:30 AM on July 18, 2015.</p>
<p>The BC Prosecution Service approved the charges on Tuesday, December 19, 2017, following a 15-month investigation by the Independent Investigations Office of British Columbia, the unit that investigates police harm to civilians in the province.  Incredibly, the IIO wrapped up its investigation and sent its report to the BC Prosecution Service to consider charges in October of 2016. Yes, 14 months ago. So more questions are raised in a case that already has too many about why the Crown prosecutors took so long to lay charges. Is it because the killer was a police officer, an RCMP constable? This question must be asked given the tendency by Crown not to bring charges against killer cops even where charges are recommended.</p>
<p>Brooks was unarmed, dressed in shorts and flip flops when officers approached him outside the detachment. He was said to be screaming, possibly asking for help, according to some witnesses, when he was shot and killed. An officer was also shot and in first reports it was suggested that the officer had somehow been injured by Brooks, the implication being a shootout. It turns out this was a police distortion, perhaps designed to cast suspicion on the victim and to legitimize the officers’ actions publicly. It was eventually revealed that the officer had been shot by a weapon fired by police (no weapons other than police weapons were on the scene).</p>
<p>This has been a grueling process for the Brooks family who have worked hard to gain information about the killing of their loved one and to see those officers responsible held to some account. Family and friends of Hudson Brooks started a movement called Justice For Hudson to bring public attention to and to call for information about the police killing. They held several marches through south Surrey which were attended by hundreds of people and went right to the RCMP detachment. The Brooks family has repeatedly stated their frustration publicly with the length of time for the investigation and the lack of responsiveness by authorities.</p>

<p>A matter of seconds. That was all the time that transpired before Surrey RCMP officers decided to shoot and kill Hudson Brooks after encountering the youth,  as revealed in newly released audio of the killing.</p>
<p>Most of the significant questions about the RCMP killing of Hudson Brooks outside an RCMP community policing detachment in south Surrey, British Columbia remain unanswered almost two years after the 20-year old was shot by police on July 18, 2015. His family has persistently sought answers, both of police and the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the unit that examines police harm to civilians in the province.</p>
<p>In March 2017 police audio of the killing of Hudson Brooks was posted on YouTube. Notably, the clip was not released to family by police who have been uncommunicative regarding the killing. The audio was apparently posted by a user who regularly uploads recordings of police-involved incidents from radio traffic and scanners. The 2 minutes and 41 seconds of audio reveal the chaos of police actions and confirm the quick move by officers to deploy lethal force with virtually no interaction with, or attempt to communicate with the young man who would become their victim.</p>
<p>After hearing the audio, Jennifer Brooks, Hudson Brooks’ mother responded:  “It was devastating. It was so heartbreaking. There was no ‘stop, put up your hands,’ nothing. Within seconds of them calling upon him, he was shot. He didn’t stand a chance. How this went so wrong so quickly is unfathomable” (quoted in Chan 2017).</p>
<p>The audio confirmed what the family and some commentators have managed to piece together about the killing, from witnesses and available limited reports. Up front a female voice is heard describing Hudson Brooks. At the 52 second point, a male voice is heard saying: “I got something right here coming directly at me.” In a matter of mere seconds later: “I need help now. I need help now.” Then the call of “shots fired.”</p>
<p>The tape does confirm what many have suspected for some time, that the RCMP officer who was shot during the encounter actually shot herself. In the audio a female voice can be heard saying, “I shot myself.” This is followed by a male voice calling for emergency services: “Suspect is critical. We need a code. We need it now.” This is noteworthy because police initially used the shooting of an officer to suggest to the public that Hudson Brooks was armed and inflicted the wound, thus justifying, in their view, the deployment of lethal force.</p>
<p>The IIO has requested that the recording be taken down. Jennifer Brooks, however, says that while she would not listen too it again she supports it being publicly available so long as it does not impact the ongoing IIO investigation. In her  words: “Otherwise, the public needs to hear what happened” (quoted in Chan 2017). And answers are needed now. Why did police shoot? And why did they jump to shoot so quickly? Why did officers panic to such an extent that one would shoot herself and what does this say about the safety of any public into which such panicky officers are deployed? Too much time has passed with minimal to no information from police or the IIO.</p>

<p>After more than a year, a period in which few details have been provided to the public or family, the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia has finished its report into the police killing of 20-year-old Hudson Brooks. The young man was shot and killed by an officer outside the RCMP detachment in South Surrey on July 18, 2015, under mysterious circumstances which have long called for insight and answers. The report has been forwarded to Crown prosecutors for consideration suggesting charges could be laid against an officer or officers involved.</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks was killed while approaching the RCMP detachment in South Surrey. He was intercepted by police on 152 Street in the early morning of July 18, 2015. He was unarmed and wearing shorts and flip-flops when an officer initially targeted him for unknown reasons. Witnesses have suggested Brooks may have been experiencing some distress and seeking assistance at the time. He was shot and killed a short time after the approach by police. Early reports noted that an officer had been shot, in what seemed an attempt to legitimize police actions in the public eye. It has since been revealed that no weapon other than those of police was found on the scene and it is believed the officer’s injury was police inflicted (perhaps even self-inflicted).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consideration of Charges?</p>
<p>The IIO report has been forwarded to the Crown prosecutors for consideration of charges. This is only done in cases in which the IIO has determined that an officer involved in harm to a civilian may have committed a criminal act. In the words of IIO spokesperson Adan Buckley:</p>
<p>“At the conclusion of an investigation, if the chief civilian director of the IIO concludes that an officer may have committed any offence, then the chief civilian director will refer the case to crown. If it&#8217;s concluded the officer has not committed any offence, then the chief civilian director will publish a public report.” (quoted in Johnstone 2016)</p>
<p>While there is some relief in the consideration of charges in this case and the possibility that relevant details about the actions of police the night Hudson Brooks was killed by RCMP, there is little to suggest that police will be held accountable in any meaningful way. It is extremely rare in the Canadian state for officers to be charged when they kill civilians, even under the most clearly dubious and egregious circumstances. The state tends to protect its frontline forces. And Crown prosecutors appear reluctant to jeopardize the close relations they have with police on whose efforts their own success and careers partly depend. Over the brief history of the IIO in British Columbia, 56 reports have been forwarded to Crown for consideration of charges. Those 56 reports have resulted in charges only nine times, a tiny fraction of cases. Five cases remain undetermined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Justice for Hudson”</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks’ family has worked tirelessly to get answers about the actions of police in killing their loved one. According to his mother Jennifer Brooks: “I wouldn’t say I’m shocked because I really, really believed that this would go to Crown. I was just so happy that they closed it, because it was such a long, long wait” (quoted in Johnstone 2016).</p>
<p>Family and friends have organized a movement for “Justice For Hudson” to raise awareness about Hudson’s killing by police and to gain some sense of accountability for the force and officers involved. They have organized several rallies and marches in South Surrey and outside the RCMP detachment where Hudson Brooks was killed. These have been mass events with hundreds of people participating. This is in many ways unique in the Canadian context where ongoing rallies and protests over police killings have been less common and certainly received less media coverage and public attention than has been the case in the United States. This too s changing as a younger generation in particular has mobilized against police violence in the Canadian state.</p>
<p>The Justice for Hudson movement will continue as the case goes forward to the Crown. In the words of Jennifer Brooks: “We’re not going to wait for six months, seven months or eight months. If we have not heard anything within three months, we will plan another march because we really, really demand justice for Hudson” (quoted in Johnstone 2016).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if any of the officers involved will be brought to trial. The history in British Columbia and in Canada leaves little cause for optimism</p>

<p>Johnstone, Jesse. 2016. “Police Watchdog Sends Hudson Brooks Report to Crown for Charge Consideration.” <em>CBC News</em>. October 21. <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/hudson-brooks-charges-1.3815896"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/hudson-brooks-charges-1.3815896</a></p>

<p>It says plenty about the protections afforded police who kill civilians in Canada that months after a killing even minimal details about the event are not released to public or media. Officers involved are shielded from public scrutiny. Media are not allowed to report the issue in a manner consistent with an open and democratic system. Loved ones are left to ask painful questions. And live with excruciating silence from the agencies involved and responsible for providing answers. This serves to protect the system and allows police agencies time to reconstruct events, and their stories, to suit their own interests.</p>
<p>Seven months after Hudson Brooks, 20, was shot down in the street outside of an RCMP detachment in South Surrey, BC, the young man’s family has received no answers and few insights into how or why their loved one came to be a victim of police violence. This despite repeated requests made to the RCMP and the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the province’s police oversight body for information. This despite public appeals for disclosure from the RCMP, IIO, and local politicians, including two marches involving hundreds of supporters.</p>
<p>What is known for sure is that Hudson Brooks was shot multiple times and killed by an RCMP officer or officers outside the force’s South Surrey detachment. The IIO, in one of its few informational statements on the killing, has also confirmed that only a police service weapon was recovered at the scene. No other weapons were present. This is crucial because RCMP, as is often the case in police killings of civilians, initially suggested in media reports that there had been an exchange of shots between Brooks and the RCMP resulting in a gunshot wound to one officer. It now appears that the officer’s injury was either self-inflicted or a result of friendly fire. Brooks was not even wearing a t-shirt at the time he was shot and killed. He had no weapon or place to hide it.</p>
<p>Later police tried to claim that Brooks was suicidal. As in other recent cases in BC the RCMP sought to disparage and blame the victim (as if being suicidal could legitimize police killing someone—only in that authoritarian culture of impunity). Brooks family and friends have been clear and consistent that the young man was happy, optimistic, with a bright future.</p>
<p>Incredibly, neither Surrey’s Mayor Linda Hepner nor local MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) for Surrey-White Rock Gordon Hogg have contacted the Brooks family whether to provide information or even to offer condolences. In the words of Jennifer Brooks, Hudson Brooks’ mother: “Our son was shot down in the streets of Surrey—they haven’t reached out to me. Where is the compassion? A young man loses his life and we’re not contacted” (quoted in Holmes 2016). A stunning lack of compassion, and basic human decency, which would certainly not be the case in the event of a police officer being killed by a civilian.</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks’ mother has lived with indescribable pain since her son was killed by RCMP officers early in the morning on July 18, 2015. Following the February 2016 march commemorating her son, Jennifer Brooks asked: “Every moment of everyday, I wonder, I get up, first thing I think of is what happened to Hudson? How did this escalate to the point that lethal force was used on my son, my unarmed son?” (quoted in Beja 2016).<br />
There is much for the RCMP to answer for. Jennifer Brooks needs to know. The RCMP need to answer: “I don’t know why my unarmed son was shot multiple times. Why was lethal force used on Hudson? Why was he shot five to seven times? The silence is killing me. I have no answers. It’s devastating” (quoted in Chan 2016).</p>
<p>Outrageously, the IIO points to an increase in officer-involved shootings, and the strain on resources they cause, as leading to a backlog of investigations that has left many families of victims of police violence seeking answers. According to Marten Youssef, spokesperson for the IIO: “Our timeliness has suffered, and that is partly due to a spike in officer-involved shootings and officer-involved fatalities” (quoted in Beja 2016). According to provincial records, between September 2014 and December 2015, there were 20 officer-involved fatalities, 12 were firearm-related, in British Columbia. That compares to one recorded fatal shooting by police in 2013 and three fatal shootings by police in 2012. The rise in killings of civilians by police in BC has led the IIO to hire more investigators to deal with the back-log. At public expense. Yet the activities of the IIO since their inception suggest that they remain largely toothless in holding killer cop accountable or in reigning in murderous forces in the province. In effect they offer no deterrence for killer cops and minimal real oversight.</p>
<p>Jennifer Brooks suggests that the increase in police-involved shootings over the previous year points to a pressing need for better training. In her view: “When there is someone in distress, the first thing to do is not shoot, not use lethal force” (quoted in Beja 2016). In the words of Hudson Brooks’ brother Beaudry: “Too many don’t have proper training and aren’t ready for the position they are in. It leads to things like this. It shouldn’t have happened” (quoted in Chan 2016).</p>
<p>Others would suggest that disarming the police in British Columbia might be a necessary step. Others call for ending the RCMP contracts in sub/urban centers like Surrey.</p>
<p>The silence and disengagement from public requests for answers is telling in the context of RCMP targeting of Surrey for increased policing and stated efforts toward community mobilization. Indeed the RCMP has long viewed Surrey as a site of force expansion and budgetary increase. They are banking on Surrey, and fear campaigns and moral panics targeting the city, in a context in which crime rates on the whole are declining consistently over years (with associated threats to police budgets). RCMP have established a public relations outreach officer in Surrey staffed by an officer who is also part of the RCMP campaign to gain a foothold in local communities by securing a faculty position in the local university, Kwantlen Polytechnic University, that enrolls the greatest proportion of Surrey post-secondary students. This has been central in efforts to recruit younger local residents while gaining access to informants, friends and family, in the neighborhoods of Surrey.</p>
<p>Yet when families ask for answers about the RCMP killing their children, nothing.</p>

<p>Six weeks after the RCMP killing of Surrey youth Hudson Brooks (who turned 20 shortly before he was shot by police) serious, and troubling, questions remain about police actions and the situation surrounding the killing. Brooks was shot by an RCMP officer outside of a community policing office in South Surrey, BC in circumstances that have not yet been properly explained.</p>
<p>Police initially claimed that Brooks was suicidal, but have offered nothing to suggest this was actually the case, and made statements implying that an officer had been injured by Brooks in some sort of confrontation. This latter insinuation has been discredited by forensic evidence at the scene which found only police issue equipment.</p>
<p>The only information provided by police is sketchy and unverified. Police suggest that a “call for service” involving a “suicidal” man apparently screaming and in some distress in the area of the 1800-block of 152nd Street in Surrey. Officers from the community office responded, located Hudson Brooks, and in some sort of struggle shots were fired. Hudson Brooks was shot multiple times and died.</p>
<p>His mother wants answers and is working to get them: “This is my campaign for justice for Hudson. I will never stop nor rest until I receive justice, and justice means I want these officers charged. They cannot just shoot a young man and just walk away, badge or no badge” (quoted in Saltman 2015).</p>
<p>Family and friends dispute the police depiction of Brooks and his emotional state. The day that Brooks was killed he was going to the beach to be with friends, something he regularly did on weekends and was reported to be in good spirits. His mother calls police claims that Brooks was suicidal “completely untrue” and “a false accusation” (Saltman 2015). She says instead: “My son loved life. He lived life to the fullest, he was happy” (quoted in Saltman 2015). She wants to know what really happened and why. She wants to know why lethal force was deployed apparently so quickly and in the absence of non-lethal options. And, above all, she wants accountability.</p>
<p>Family, friends, and supporters are organizing a community march for September 26, 2015 to honor Hudson and others killed through interaction with police. The march will begin at 152nd Street and 16th Avenue in Surrey and continue along 152nd Street to around 24th Avenue. Marchers intend to gather at the memorial in front of the South Surrey RCMP office. Sweatshirts, stickers, and bracelets with the slogan “#JusticeForHudson” are also being produced and distributed by supporters.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office of B.C. is still investigating the shooting. The RCMP report that the “subject officer” is currently on administrative duties.</p>

<p>On Saturday, July 18, 2015, Hudson Daryl Willis Brooks (20) was killed by RCMP right in front of the District Office in South Surrey, BC. The young man was reported to be in some distress before being shot by RCMP after apparently minimal engagement. No independent reports or witness statements have been released. Police provided few details even days after the killing. This killing by RCMP once again raises serious concerns about deadly police interactions with people who may be experiencing mental health issues and the quickness of police to deploy lethal force upon encountering people in distress. Initially RCMP reported that an officer had also been shot, leaving the impression that the man they killed may have shot the officer. It was revealed days later (Monday, July 21) that the injured officer had been shot by another RCMP member.</p>

<p>How does an argument between a landscape professional and a careless resident watering the lawn during a drought and city water use restrictions end up with the concerned landscaper being killed by police? How is it that a young man, described as quiet and peaceful, comes to be viciously attacked by police officers using chemical weapons and is beaten so brutally that his grieving family has to have a closed casket funeral?</p>
<p>These fundamental questions remain to be answered in the case of the police killing of Myles Gray. This despite the pleas of family members for information. Other fundamental questions stand out with regard to police involved killings of civilians in British Columbia. So too do questions about the supposed investigations unit and civilian concerns with oversight of police in the province.</p>
<p>How is it that in a province in which there is a supposedly independent investigations unit legislatively tasked with investigating all cases in which police harm or kill a civilian there is no report years after the killing? And how is it that despite requirements that police immediately notify the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) when such occasions of force against civilians have occurred, and involved officers not communicate with one another, that there can be both a delay in notification and communications between involved officers, yet no officer is punished or in any way held accountable? And why, in British Columbia, are so many families of victims killed by police left with no answers and no insights into the events that left their loved ones dead at the hands of officers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suing for Answers in the Police Killing of Myles Gray</p>
<p>Six months after their son was killed by police, under mysterious, troubling, and still shrouded circumstances, in a backyard in Burnaby, the parents of 33 year old Myles Gray are still seeking answers. Among the few basic facts that are known about the killing of Myles Gray on the afternoon of August 13, 2015, is that officers encountered the young man after responding to a call regarding a disturbance on the 3600 block of South East Marine Drive in Vancouver. It is also known that that afternoon Myles Gray, who worked as a greenery supplier to local florist wholesalers, had argued with a woman who was watering her garden during drought restrictions. Beyond that questions abound.</p>
<p>Having received no insights into their son’s death at the hands of police they have been compelled to file a lawsuit against the Vancouver police and 11 of the force’s officers. This is the only means available to them to get an honest response from police about what happened when their son’s life was taken.</p>
<p>In addition to the Vancouver Police Department and the officers, the Grays, along with Myles Gray’s evergreen supply company, Graystone Enterprises Ltd, also name the City of Vancouver and the Vancouver Police Board in the lawsuit. The board is cited for “failing properly and effectively to educate, train and supervise the officers to appropriate professional standards” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>In the suit, Myles Gray’s parents, Margie and Mark Gray of Sechelt, allege that seven of those officers, still identified only as “John Does,” wrongfully killed their son by beating him to death. According to the claim, the police killed Myles Gray by using “grossly excessive force” and “inflicting massive physical trauma … with no valid, lawful reason” (quoted in Rankin 2016). The suit also alleges that officers had no lawful cause or authority to detain Myles Gray and that he was repeatedly beaten, even after he had been restrained. All officers involved have been and remain on active duty since the killing.</p>
<p>Margie Gray reports being told that her son died within minutes of the encounter with Vancouver officers. Her assessment is stark, and accurate: “This is ‘comply or die’ policing. Like, what was the rush to move in and kill him?” (quoted in Rankin 2016). Adds Mark Gray: “You know, they could have let him calm down …. like a person’s life is worth more than a (few) minutes, right?” (quoted in Rankin 2016). The family, and indeed many reasonably thinking people, can envision a broad range of alternative approaches that could have been taken that would not have left a young man beaten to death.</p>
<p>Grieving father Mark Gray is left with the terrible question: “Why was he killed off, just hunted down like a dog, killed like a dog, worse than a dog?” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>Families of almost all victims of people killed by police in Canada are provided with very little information about what the police did to their loved ones. They are almost never given the names of officers involved as these are not even made available to the general public. This is the case for Myles Gray’s parents. Their requests are straightforward and legitimate. Says Margie Gray: “I want answers. I want to know what happened that day. It&#8217;s the worst. It is horrific. And to know this went down at the hands of people you&#8217;re supposed to trust” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is Known</p>
<p>The day Myles Gray would be killed by police begins routinely enough. On a hot August day, the young greenery supplier was on a regular run of deliveries to flower wholesales in the area around Boundary Road and Marine Drive in Burnaby. Sometime around 2 pm, Gray wandered away from a loading bay and walked across a small overpass above Boundary Road, a dividing line between Burnaby and Vancouver. Coming down the overpass he found himself on the 3600 block of South East Marine Drive in Vancouver. A lover of the outdoors Myles Gray often went for walks during breaks in his delivery schedule. According to ahis father he left his keys, backpack, and identification inside the delivery van and headed off in the direction of a nearby park (Olivier 2016). Based on a map of the area it is believed that Myles Gray was heading toward Everett Crowley Park on the Vancouver side of Boundary Road. A worker at the florist supply store where Gray made his delivery saw him leaving with his headphones on. They waved at each other (Olivier 2016). According to his father: “There is a little park up there. He did the loop and was heading back. And I guess he saw this lady watering her grass” (quoted in Olivier 2016). It would prove to be a fatal encounter.</p>
<p>According to a neighborhood witness, Gray and a local woman ended up in an argument as she watered her garden under conditions of drought restrictions. At the time of the encounter, Metro Vancouver was under a Stage 3 restriction on water use and this included a complete ban on watering of lawns (Olivier 2016).</p>
<p>While it might not seem at all out of the ordinary for a greenery worker to be concerned about water usage on a lawn during a drought, for some reason police were called in this case. That fact raises real concerns about social disconnection, authoritarianism, and snitch tendencies within a fear culture, but these questions cannot be answered here.</p>
<p>What is clear is that 911 was called by the woman’s son and police responded (though again it might be asked why police treated an argument over lawn watering as a priority incident or why the person arguing against lawn watering during a drought was viewed as a perpetrator).</p>
<p>The woman involved has told reporters that she did indeed contact police after a verbal exchange with a man over her use of her water hose during a watering ban. She insists that she had never intended for anything bad to happen to him. It all began with a painful banality. She simply wanted the young man to go away (which it seems he was going to do on his own anyway). Upon finding out that the man had died through his encounter with police she says she was devastated (Olivier 2016). She says now: “I cried. Now when I talk about it, I get really angry” (quoted in Olivier 2016).</p>
<p>Upon encountering Gray the Vancouver police officers chase their presumed target across a Boundary Road overpass into Burnaby. Having cornered Gray in a residential yard police deploy the Orwellian named “chemical agents” and then “physical force” supposedly in an effort to restrain him. A short time after the encounter in the yard, and still an apparently short time after police first engaged him Gray was pronounced dead. It is also known that Myles Gray’s injuries were so severe that the funeral home suggested there not be an open casket funeral.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit filed in BC Supreme Court, Gray was “alone, unarmed, dressed in shorts and not engaged in any criminal activity during his interactions with the seven officers” (quoted in Rankin 2016). He was killed in the secluded backyard of a house in the 8300 block of Joffre Avenue. This was a mere 10 minute walk from where the original complaint had been made to police (Olivier 2016).</p>
<p>Immediately after Myles Gray was killed his father Mark visited the backyard where his son was killed by police. The yard on Joffre Avenue backs into a steep ravine filled with blackberry bushes (Olivier 2016). The father believes his son was at that point cornered with nowhere to go. This raises further questions about why police could not have engaged him more cautiously and communicatively. Why did they quickly move to force? He could have posed no harm to the general public or bystanders. He could not have gotten away. Mark Gray says that when he visited the yard there were still signs of the struggle. He saw patches of blood, torn up grass, and a destroyed rhododendron bush (Olivier 2016). The thought of what happened is unbearable:</p>
<p>“I can’t get past what happened — I can’t move on. I just feel bad that I wasn’t there to help him. I just wish I was there to help him. I would have in a second died for my son. I still would love to be dead and he still been alive. The thought of him, thinking how he suffered…” (quoted in Olivier 2016)</p>
<p>According to a police news release issued after the killing, one of the few communications from any state authorities in this case, Vancouver police reported that their members responded to a call of a distraught man causing a disturbance. The police account reads in part:</p>
<p>“He [Gary] became agitated and additional officers were called to the scene. Attempts to subdue the man with chemical agents were unsuccessful. A physical altercation ensued, resulting in injuries to the man and six officers. Paramedics were called to attend to the man. He died at the scene.” (quoted in Rankin 2016)</p>
<p>None of this, including the timelines involved (when police were sent, when reinforcements were sent or arrived, when chemical agents were applied, what the altercation consisted of) has been confirmed by independent sources. No specific details on any of this have been provided publicly in any way.</p>
<p>Even more the lawsuit suggests interference by police with the investigation by the Independent Investigations Office in British Columbia, the unit charged with investigating cases in which civilians are injured or killed by police. The lawsuit alleges that “the police unlawfully impeded the investigation … by the Independent Investigations Office by failing to immediately notify the IIO of the killing” (quoted in Rankin 2016). Myles Gray’s parents allege that during the delay, “officers failed to preserve evidence” and “conferred among themselves” (quoted in Rankin 2016). These claims are similar to the case of police involved in the killing of Robert Dziekanski in which the officers responsible were found to have colluded in crafting their explanation of what happened (before evidence in a citizen video showed what really occurred). Ironically perhaps it was the inquiry into the Dziekanski killing that led to the formation of the provincial police oversight body in British Columbia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds of Silence: The Authorities (Do Not) Respond</p>
<p>Another thing that is known is that for six months authorities have remained silent on the cause or he conditions surrounding Myles Gray’s death. The blue wall of silence remains solidly in place in this case. The Vancouver Police Department only offer this: “It wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate for the VPD to comment on an ongoing IIO investigation or a pending civil process” (quoted in Rankin). For its part the BC Coroners Service claims that it cannot comment while the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) investigates the case. At the same time the IIO, through spokesperson Marten Youssef insists: “Our investigation in this critical incident is ongoing. We are currently waiting on third party reports” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>Incredibly, and this is a situation we have discussed previously in some detail, one of the main reasons put forward by the IIO for the ongoing delays in its investigations is the fact that police in British Columbia are harming and killing so many people over the last few years. As Youseff claims:</p>
<p>“The timeliness of our investigations has suffered recently, in large part, as the result of a rash of officer-involved shootings and police-involved fatalities throughout the province that began in September of 2014 and continued for the better part of a year (a total of 20 shootings and fatalities in a period of 12 months).” (quoted in Rankin 2016)</p>
<p>One might ask whether the delays in the face of growing police violence is related to the training hat IIO investigators receive from the Justice Institute of British Columbia, the training academy staffed by and geared toward police officers. One might also ask why provincial resources are not forthcoming given the apparent need to step up investigations of officers through the IIO?</p>
<p>In the face of this terrible situation the Gray family asks for de-escalation training to be improved within the Vancouver Police Department. Their wish is that changes will come, in part through the impetus of their lawsuit, so that their son’s death will not have been in vain.</p>
<p>Gray’s parents knew him as someone who was gentle and walked away from fights. If he was involved in some sort of difficulty on August 13 it was not in character. In fact there is still no evidence that suggests Myles Gray was either in a vulnerable state or suffering from some sort of mental health crisis (apart from any stress caused by being chased and attacked by police of course)a psychotic break. Neither is there any evidence to suggest that he was under the influence of any intoxicants. On the morning he died he was reported to be happy and in normal spirits according to his workers. While granting that something could have upset him later, though there is no evidence for this, the family and colleagues also note that it need not have led to his death: “Maybe he was having an emotional meltdown. He was probably in a vulnerable state. They pursued him for sure. What he needed probably was some compassion” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>And compassion is certainly what Myles Gray did not receive. The list of people in need of compassion who instead encounter police is a growing one in the Canadian context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comply or Die</p>
<p>As in numerous other cases in which several police encounter someone who is spatially contained with nowhere to go, and no way to harm bystanders, there are serious questions why police so quickly resort to lethal force. The mindset and practice of the police assert a framework in which the only option is “comply or die.” A purely authoritarian assertion. Recommendations have long been made about better training, including de-escalation training. Others have raised the possibility of mental health or health care professionals responding instead of or along with police.</p>
<p>These are questions that weigh on Mark Gray. He suggests: “They should definitely have better training. If there&#8217;s seven of them, one should have said, ‘Hey, let&#8217;s back off’ and treat this a little differently in how it went down. It could have gone down a lot differently. And Myles could have been alive today” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>This sentiment is echoed by Margie Gray. In her words:</p>
<p>“There needs to be a change in the way they deal with people. They need more training in their de-escalation skills. They just need more training, period … no one should have to live through what we’ve been living through. It’s a living hell. I do not want any family to ever have to go through what we’ve been going through.” (quoted in Rankin 2016)</p>
<p>She further adds: “Even getting the details are not going to bring my son back. But in going forward, hopefully there is going to be change. This cannot happen to anybody else. Because I feel like if this happened to our family, it can literally happen to anyone’s family” (quoted in Olivier 2016). Given the histories of police killings of civilians in Canada there is little reason for optimism that charges will be laid against any of the officers involved.</p>
<p>And no family should have to go through any of this. In too many cases police are deployed in cases for which they are neither prepared nor equipped. At the same time they interact in those situations, even where the behavior that brought the call is minor, on an absolutist basis pursuing the authoritarian and violent lines that have been ingrained in them (and which are the basis of their operations). With no leeway, or inclination, to soften the approach or act in a more nuanced way. Of course, real care, service, and protection of regular humans in need has never been the purpose or role of police in state capitalist contexts (or any other context for that matter).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion: Why Call the Cops Anyway?</p>
<p>From another, more critical, perspective one might question why state authorities are deployed in such circumstances at all. Clearly arguments over lawn care, and civic responsibilities during water shortages, should not result in calls to the state or to the deployment of armed forces. Larger questions remain about sociality and social engagement in anomic, detached, privatized societies. One of the problems with policing is that it breeds reliance or dependence on policing. People do not resolve social differences, even minor ones, through discussion or agreement to disagree, Instead the initial, almost reflexive, response is to call the cops. And unfortunately the cops are all too willing to oblige (it builds public relations and helps maintain or increase budgets after all). So-called “tough on crime” or broken windows approaches I the context of broader socio-political cultures of fear and panic only make things worse.</p>
<p>The sociologist Emile Durkheim suggested that in stratified societies with a broad division of labor, as in advanced capitalist modernity, are subject to conditions of anomie or a breakdown of shared norms, values, and beliefs (the conscience collective). Such societies are marked by a lack of trust among people and a tendency toward dependence on authorities. Under these conditions, and manipulable fear that accompanies them, people turn too readily to authorities and are too accepting of the actions taken by authorities however egregious they might be. Thus police are able to kill and get away with killing while remaining silent or worse obstructionist or disassembling in the face of questions from the loved ones of those whose lives have been taken.</p>
<p>As Mark Gray puts it: “I want my son back, but that’s never going to happen. It could be (that) other people will have their son killed, and it’s just not right the way they treat people. It’s just not right” (quoted in Ranking 2016).</p>

<p>In the afternoon of Thursday, August 13, 2015 (around 2:30) Vancouver Police Department Officers killed a man described by media as being “distraught.” Numerous officers engaged the man and chemical agents were deployed. The man died following some type of physical intervention by officers. The name of the victim was only released on Wednesday, August 19. He was identified by the B.C. Coroners Service as Myles Gray, 33, of Sechelt. The Independent Investigations Office is investigating.</p>

0090-V1,"Family members called 911 to report escalating concerns about Haki Sefa, an independent investigation found. Police said when they spotted Sefa's van they attempted to pull him over, but a pursuit resulted. Informed Sefa was suicidal and likely armed with a gun, police conducted a high-risk takedown, forcing Sefa's vehicle to stop. Four officers leaped from their cars, three with guns drawn. Police said when Sefa pointed a handgun at the officer who didn't have a gun in his hand, the three other officers opened fire, killing Sefa. The investigation cleared the officers.
<p>A 44 year old man, later identified as Haki Sefa, was shot dead by Winnipeg police late Sunday night, September 20, 2015. Sefa, a father of four who worked as a plumber, died from wounds received during an interaction with police on Highway 59 near Kirkness Road north of Winnipeg. He had been followed by police after a call was put in by a family member concerned about his well being.</p>
<p>Early reports suggested that Sefa had become depressed, perhaps suicidal, following the death of his niece Breanna Kannick, whom he helped raise, last month. Sadly the young woman was herself a victim of police intervention, having died in a Regina jail cell from apparent drug withdrawal under troubling circumstances about which there have been many questions raised but not yet answered.</p>
<p>Police following Sefa trapped his vehicle between two police vehicles before the shooting started. Witnesses reported hearing several shots (four or five) fired at the time Sefa was killed. Around 12 officers were involved in the shooting.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba (IIUM) is investigating. The IIU was formed to investigate cases in which civilians are hurt or killed by police officers and was only officially instituted in June. This will be its first case.

Dicesare, who police believed was armed with an Uzi submachine-gun, called 911 during the incident and stayed on the line with the operator for 32 minutes until the shooting. When he finally came to a stop he pointed the Uzi at the officers, who opened fire. Dicesare was struck by nine bullets. The investigation found no cause to lay charges against the officers.
<p>A man, identified as Mark Dicesare (24), shot multiple times by Winnipeg police following pursuit by dozens of police vehicles died of multiple injuries inflicted by police on November 6, 2015. His death was announced on November 7.</p>
<p>Winnipeg police have still released few details of the killing but they have confirmed that firearm discharge occurred, involving their officers. Witnesses, including at least one news reporter, have stated that multiple officers opened fire on the man simultaneously during a brief standoff in a field in the city near Lipsett Hall at the former Kapyong Barracks military site.</p>
<p>Several police vehicles had pursued the man to the field after he was reportedly see driving erratically. Witnesses reported around 30 police vehicles involved in the standoff. The shooting occurred about 45 minutes after police first became involved and during a 20 minute standoff.</p>
<p>Local radio station CJOB recorded the observation of one witness identified as Brian who saw police open fire on the man: “The driver &#8230; came out, had his hands in his coat breast pocket, took his hand outside of his jacket, and at least ten to twelve officers just opened fire and blew the heck out of him” (CP 2015).</p>
<p>CBC Winnipeg recorded a lengthy witness account of the killing:</p>
<p>“A white man with black hair, black jacket got out [and] started walking around his vehicle very nervously, had his hand in his jacket pocket, inside his jacket, started to pull his hand out of his jacket. And I&#8217;d have to say 10 to 12 police officers just rapid-fire opened up, and that was it. It was just, &#8216;Bang, bang, bang&#8217; all at the same time. It&#8217;s just like a movie; it&#8217;s just unbelievable. Like, it just wasn&#8217;t one shot. It sounded [like] at least 10, all at the same time.” (CBC 2015)</p>

An officer partially kicked in the door in and saw Gonzalez holding a toilet lid above his head. Seven officers moved in, shocked Gonzalez with a stun gun, handcuffed him and strapped him to a stretcher for transfer under the Mental Health Act. Rodrigo died the next day in hospital. Police said later Gonzales had been armed with a screwdriver, though the investigation didn't find one at the scene. Investigators said they found no evidence of excessive force.
<p>On November 7, 2017, Rodrigo Hector Almonacid Gonzalez, a hospital worker and father of two young sons, died from injuries sustained in an interaction with Toronto police. Less than a day before more than ten Toronto Police officers, including a tactical squad equipped with a battering ram and shields, had forced their way into the Gonzalez home where the 43 year old occupant had apparently locked himself in his bathroom for reasons yet unknown. During the police encounter two Tasers were deployed against Gonzalez and he was taken from the building on a stretcher.</p>
<p>Photographs taken by Gonzalez’s wife at the hospital reveal horrific injuries including a bloody head injury, a black eye, bruising on an arm and shoulder, and what the family believes to be a Taser mark near the victim’s groin. The family was notified that Gonzalez had internal bleeding shortly before he succumbed to his injuries. His mother and wife reported than he had no injuries before police arrived. They also reported being kept from entering the apartment by police officers.</p>
<p>Disturbingly, despite the injuries sustained by the victim in his encounter with police and despite his death in hospital the next day, the province’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), tasked with investigating all such incidents of police involved civilian harm, took five days before showing up at the apartment to investigate. The family was not told to preserve the scene in the bathroom where the encounter is believed to have occurred and it is not clear if essential evidence has been lost as a result. SIU should have attended and secured the scene directly once it was reported.</p>
<p>Toronto police have refused to comment on the case but an SIU spokesperson confirmed that police reported the incident the day it happened and notified the SIU when Gonzalez died the next day. No answer has been given by SIU for why it took their investigators four days to contact the family. Three SIU investigators and one forensic investigator have since been assigned to the case.</p>

0094-V1,"A police pursuit ended with a Quebec provincial police officer fatally shooting Brandon Maurice, 17. Maurice had stopped his car, but then backed up, hitting the cruiser, a review by prosecutors determined. When Maurice refused an order to get out of his car, an officer broke the window to try to open the door. Maurice grabbed him by the arm and accelerated, dragging and injuring the officer who shot Maurice. The prosecution review concluded no charges were warranted against the officer, but an inquest has been ordered.
<p>The Sûreté du Québec (SQ) officer who killed 17-year-old Brandon Maurice has been identified as Constable Frédéric Fortier during the coroner’s inquest into the 2015 killing. An expert in police “use of force” strategies testified at the inquest that the provincial police officer made a number of critical mistakes. A witness to the killing, Chris Houle, who was in the car with Maurice when the teenager was shot has already testified that the shooting “should have been avoided.”</p>
<p>Constable Frédéric Fortier shot the unarmed Maurice at the end of a police chase through Messines, Québec. He and his partner, Constable Dave Constantin, were cleared of criminal wrong doing after an investigation, that was in no way independent and involved Montreal police in 2016.</p>
<p>The inquest has focused on how Fortier approached the car Maurice was driving at the end of a police pursuit. He approached aggressively with his gun drawn and decided to smash the driver’s-side window to open the car door.</p>
<p>Bruno Poulin, an expert with Quebec’s police academy, so not oppositional to police in any way, testified that the encounter should never have ended with that decision. According to Poulin, the officer narrowed his options by approaching the car overly aggressively and expecting he could physically force the driver from the car. A typical thug approach by police who expect they can impose their authority without question and, if necessary, kill to deal with any mess they create.</p>
<p>In Poulin’s words to the inquest: “He put himself in danger” (quoted in 2018). Poulin said it appears that SQ officers need some retraining. We know that training does nothing to change the power police hold in society and the fact that they can kill with impunity as part of the state’s assertion of its monopoly on violence.</p>
<p>In testimony the previous day Fortier acknowledged that he had gotten himself into trouble but said he would not change his decision to shoot.</p>

<p>Chris Houle, the person who directly witnessed the police shooting of 17-year-old Brandon Maurice told a coroner’s inquest that it should never have happened. Houle saw the entire interaction from the passenger seat of Maurice’s car. A Sûreté du Québec (SQ), Quebec provincial police, officer shot Maurice as the teen sat in the vehicle’s driver’s seat in the early morning hours of November 16, 2015. The Inquest started in April, 2018.</p>
<p>Said Houle, during his testimony before chief coroner Catherine Rudel-Tessier on April 10: “I may not know a lot about law and police processes; I’m not an expert. But this should have been avoided” (quoted in Pfeffer 2018). The young witness testified over a day and a half.</p>
<p>The killing occurred after a police chase ended about 10 kilometers at chemin de la Ferme and rue Patry, close to Lac Blue Sea in the municipality of Messines, Quebec. Houle testified that he and Maurice sat in the car as an officer approached the driver’s side with his gun drawn. At some point the officer smashed the window and reached into the car. Some type of struggle ensued over the opening of the car door. The officer fired his gun at Maurice shooting the teenager at point-blank range.</p>
<p>Brandon Maurice died in hospital. The pathologist who carried out the autopsy testified at the inquest that Maurice died from a fatal bullet wound through this neck.</p>
<p>Family and friends of Maurice have long insisted that police used excessive force during the encounter and have demanded answers about what happened that day and why police acted the way they did. The officer responsible was not charged for the killing, a typical and in no way surprising outcome when police kill civilians in Canada. The state protects the state.</p>
<p>There is no investigation of police in Quebec that could in any way be considered independent or autonomous. Incredibly Montreal police were asked by Quebec’s police “watchdog,” Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), to conduct an investigation after the killiing. This is not independence. Not surprisingly that “investigation” decided not to charge the officer. In fact the Montreal investigators were allowed to testify at the inquest.</p>

<p>Brandon Maurice was shot and killed by a Sûreté du Québec officer on November 16, 2015 in Messine (near Maniwaki) following a vehicular pursuit. On May 19, 2017, the province’s chief coroner,  Catherine Rudel-Tessier, ordered an inquest into the teenager’s killing by police. The inquest will be overseen by deputy chief coroner Luc Malouin. It cannot assign blame but can only make recommendations to address future such incidents. These are typically ignored or not implemented by police agencies under review.</p>
<p>Montreal police investigated their provincial colleagues, completing their examination in June 2016. Quite predictably they found for their colleague and concluded that no charges would be brought against their fellow officer. Yet the officer had fired wildly in the general direction of the driver, said to have been Maurice, and only luckily avoided hitting a passenger in the vehicle.</p>
<p>Maurice’s family was not satisfied with that investigation and found it illegitimate for police to be investigating police. In the words of Brandon Maurice’s mother, Dominique Bernier in 2016: “Police officers protect each other.” Indeed they do. The family’s view, quite reasonable, is that  investigations cannot be impartial when police investigate their colleagues. The family believes the officer used force that was excessive for a stopped car starting to drive away from an officer.</p>

<p>A teenager, Brandon Maurice (17), was shot and killed by an officer of the Sûreté du Québec (the Québec provincial police force) south of Maniwaki Québec early in the morning of Monday, November 16.

When the teen attempted to drive away the officer fired his weapon at him striking the young driver at least once. The teen was taken to the hospital in critical condition and police announced Monday afternoon that he had died of his wounds. The name and age of the victim were released by family.

The officer opened fire, killing Campbell and striking passenger Lori Flett in the head. Flett suffered bullet fragments in her brain, facial paralysis, loss of hearing, challenges to her balance and ""severe ongoing mental distress,"" and an independent investigation found ""reasonable grounds"" to lay charges. The officer has since been charged with manslaughter, criminal negligence causing death, reckless discharge of a firearm, criminal negligence causing bodily harm and dangerous driving causing bodily harm.; Responding to a call of an impaired driver, a police officer pursued Steven Douglas Campbell's vehicle down an ATV trail.

Flett suffered bullet fragments in her brain, facial paralysis, loss of hearing, challenges to her balance and ""severe ongoing mental distress,"" and an independent investigation found ""reasonable grounds"" to lay charges. For ramming Campbell's vehicle, the officer was found guilty of criminal negligence causing bodily harm and received three years probation. He was found not guilty of manslaughter in connection to the shooting.
<p>It is among the rarest of occurrences for a police officer who kills someone, even under the most dubious of circumstances, to be charged with anything related to the killing. As documented at this site are virtually never charged, and more a range of administrative mechanisms (inquests, inquiries, oversight bodies, etc.) are mobilized to legitimize the cops’ deadly actions. So it is of some note when a killer cop is actually charged, even if the courts often dismiss the charges or find for the killers.</p>
<p>Manitoba RCMP Constable Abram Letkeman has been charged with manslaughter, criminal negligence causing death, reckless discharge of a firearm, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and dangerous driving causing bodily harm is the shooting and killing of Steven Campbell (39), a father of two, in Thompson, Manitoba in 2015. Constable Letkeman was arrested March 1, 2017. Letkeman shot and killed Campbell following a police chase on November 21, 2015. Shots fired by the officer also hit the mother of Campbell daughter, resulting in serious injuries (Taylor 2017). There were two other passengers in the vehicle into which Letkeman fired.</p>
<p>The province’s Independent Investigation Unit (IIU), which examines harm done by police to civilians in Manitoba, investigated the circumstances surrounding the shooting and killing and determined that there were grounds to lay charges. The manslaughter charge is the most serious charge recommended by the IIU since it started its work in June of 2015, reinforcing the fact that police rarely face appropriate charges when they kill civilians. The Chief Medical Examiner’s Office had called an inquest into Campbell&#8217;s death in August 2016.</p>
<p>The family has always viewed  the RCMP version of events as “ a joke” (Taylor 2017). From the perspective of Shannon Heck, Campbell’s younger sister, the manslaughter charges do not go far enough ad do not reflect the, in her view, murderous approach taken by Constable : “The officer is somebody who is supposed to be able to keep his calm and cool and for some reason or other he didn’t do that and he didn’t act appropriately. I don’t think charging him with manslaughter is appropriate” (quoted in Taylor 2017).</p>
<p>The RCMP claim that Steven Campbell was driving erratically when RCMP officers pulled him over. They also claim that as one officer approach the vehicle Campbell accelerated his vehicle and him. RCMP say it was only then that shots were fired. These claims have not been independently confirmed and the family says that Campbell did not accelerate and did not even hit any officer. A passenger in the vehicle says Letkeman slammed his police car into the vehicle Campbell was driving, stopping it. She also claims the officer fired nine times into the vehicle (Graham 2017). What has been confirmed is that Constable Abram Letkeman fired wildly into the vehicle hitting and killing Campbell and critically injuring his partner (Taylor 2017).</p>
<p>From the family’s understanding of events: “The story the RCMP was releasing, it was a joke as far as we were concerned. We knew something else had happened and we knew that the truth would come out” (Heck quoted in Taylor 2017). As Shannon Heck says, at the end of the day: “My brother will never be brought back” (quoted in Taylor 2017).</p>
<p>Letkeman, a seven-year veteran of the RCMP, had been deployed out of the Portage la Prairie, detachment. He has been released on bail with conditions to appear at Provincial Court in Thompson at 10 AM on March 31, 2017. He is still being paid as an officer of the RCMP as he has been since the killing in 2015.</p>

0102-V1,"Police were responding to a call made by a transit driver after a bullet hit his bus. According to an independent investigation, when police arrived at David William McQueen's home they found bullet holes in a front window. During a 90-minute standoff the paraplegic who struggled with mental illness fired a gun through the windows, roof and walls of his home. When a tactical team moved in McQueen emerged from the backdoor in a wheelchair holding a gun and fired two rounds. Police returned fire, striking McQueen in the head.
<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the unit that investigates police harm to civilians, has cleared the repeat killer cop and the other Calgary police officers who shot and killed David McQueen, a 53-year-old quadriplegic man in a wheelchair, on January 24, 2016. ASIRT reported that several officers opened fire on McQueen with the last round fired , a bullet from a sniper, striking him in the head and killing him, but said the officers involved were fully justified in the killing. Police had reportedly responded to reports of McQueen firing a round from inside his house. Police fired tear gas into McQueen’s house driving him outside where they shot and killed him.</p>
<p>The killing of McQueen, quadriplegic with limited use of hands, in a wheelchair in his home, experiencing some mental distress has raised many disturbing questions. One of these relates to the fact that a officer who shot at McQueen was a killer cop who had committed a fatal shooting only a year before. That officer shot 27-year-old Anthony Heffernan four times, with three shots to the head and neck, on March 16, 2015. Heffernan had also been in some distress but was alone and confined to his hotel room and posed no threat to anyone, police or public, when police broke into his room and shot and killed him there.</p>
<p>The ASIRT investigation into Heffernan’s killing actually found evidence that an offense had been committed by police. The Crown claimed that there was not enough evidence to gain a conviction against the officer and did not pursue charges. The state certainly protects the state. The Heffernan family is suing Calgary police over the killing of their loved one.</p>
<p>In the ASIRT release on the McQueen killing, Susan Hughson, executive director of ASIRT, suggested that the killer cop’s involvement in the Heffernan case has no bearing on his right to use his firearm in another case. According to Hughson:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You have to look at the incidents independently and look at the circumstances surrounding them to determine whether the steps taken or the actions taken were justified. And, just because the officer has been involved in another officer-involved shooting, he does not lose the protection of the law.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protection to kill civilians? Others might ask why the officer was still on the force and being deployed in such situations of a person in distress.</p>
<p>Director Hughson, noted McQueen’s distress: “There’s no doubt that this man was in crisis on this date.” Hughson noted that McQueen had been “struggling physically, emotionally and financially” in the days prior to his being killed by police. He has been particularly upset by the death of his beloved dog only the week before. Disturbingly ASIRT appeared to use this fact to make reference to a bogus “suicide by cop” defense for the police killing of David McQueen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Canadian state context there are few legal outcomes as rare as a police officer being convicted for killing a civilian. It is rare enough that an officer who kills someone is even charged for the taking of someone’s life. This is true even in those provinces that have separate investigations units that look into killings by police rather than simply turning a case over to another police force to “investigate.” Indeed as the recent decision by Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) not to bring charges in the police killing of Andrew Loku and ongoing criticisms of the backlogged Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia show, these agencies remain limited, and often impede by or too close to, police departments involved in killings. The Loku killing in particular has led to community mobilizations by Black Lives Matter Toronto and allies.</p>
<p>Still it is safe to assume that most residents of provinces that have a dedicated unit that investigates police killings of civilians, like Alberta, would expect that any officer involved in killing a civilian would, at the very least, be taken off of active street duty while under investigation or before any conclusions are released to the public. If an officer may have acted inappropriately, unduly, disgracefully it would only make sense that they would not be released upon the public until review of the officer, their outlook, and conduct was completed and some assessment made. Surely a killer cop would not be turned out on the streets to kill again.</p>
<p>Well, incredibly, stunningly, it seems that just such a situation has been allowed to happen in Alberta with, perhaps predictably, lethal consequences. On January 25, 2016 David McQueen, a quadriplegic, was shot by three Calgary police officers while in his wheelchair inside the doorway to his house. In March 2016 it was revealed that one of the officers who shot McQueen was, at the very moment he fired his weapon, under investigation by the province’s investigation unit ASIRT (Alberta Serious Incident Response Team) for killing another man a year earlier. And he had not been cleared of wrongdoing in the previous killing.</p>
<p>Less than a year before, on March 16, 2015, the officer who would be involved in McQueen’s killing, had shot Anthony Heffernan four times, three times in the head, while the young man was alone and in some distress, but defenseless, in a hotel room. In fact police broke down the door to forcibly enter Heffernan’s room in a Hotel 8 before shooting him.</p>
<p>Said Grant Heffernan, Anthony’s brother, upon hearing the news that the very cop who killed his brother had killed again: &#8220;I am more than outraged that this happened to somebody else in Calgary” (quoted in Grant 2016). The family had been told by ASIRT that as of November 2015 the officer had not returned to work but was actively trying to get back on the job (Grant 2016). Heffernan suggests that family could have dealt with the officer being placed on administrative duty, though they by no means saw this as ideal in the circumstances (Grant 2016). They were shocked that he had been returned to the streets. As Grant Heffernan said upon hearing that the same officer that killed his brother had killed again: &#8220;This is unfathomable that this happened and is totally unacceptable&#8221; (Grant 2016).</p>
<p>The Heffernan family lawyer echoed those sentiments. Tom Engel, commenting on the return of the officer to street duty ahead of being cleared by ASIRT and the Alberta Crown prosecutor:  &#8220;Frankly, it&#8217;s shocking. You have to respect the presumption of innocence. I don&#8217;t think that you should necessarily suspend the officer from all police duties, but you certainly would take him off the street so that he wouldn&#8217;t be in a position to do that again&#8221; (quoted in Grant 2016).</p>
<p>There are many questions to be answered in trying to figure out how a young man missing his check-out time could escalate so quickly to his being shot and killed by police. When he had no weapon and no capacity to harm the public (being isolated in a hotel room by himself).</p>
<p>There are also significant questions about how and why an officer under review for a killing of a civilian could be out on the streets to kill again. When a police officer is involved in a shooting, he or she is placed on a minimum 30 day administrative leave. At the end of that period, an evaluation is supposed to be undertaken to determine whether the officer can return to active duty and whether restrictions, and what type of restrictions, will be placed on them following their return. In this case it is not yet clear why the officer was allowed to return to the streets and what, if any, restrictions governed their activity.</p>
<p>On Thursday, March 17, 2016, the Heffernan family reported that the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team has finally told them that it has recommended murder charges. The decision to lay charges rests with the Crown prosecutors. In Grant Heffernan’s words: &#8220;ASIRT is pressing hard,&#8221; (Stark 2016). This is, of course, welcome news. Charges are, as we have noted, rarely laid against officers who kill civilians, even in instances where the case would appear straightforwardly to demand charges be brought.</p>
<p>The news from ASIRT has brought some comfort to the family. Grant Heffernan suggests it is helping their recovery: &#8220;I feel a little better about it. We were very skeptical about ASIRT and any officer being charged&#8221; (quoted in Stark 2016). The family will not know until May 1 whether the Crown will, in fact, follow through and lay charges against the officer.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the police have not responded formally to this news they did offer a rather arrogant, and perhaps knowingly confident, expression of their awareness that no homicide charges have ever been laid against a Calgary police officer (Stark 2016). Such has been too consistent practice in Canada when police brutalize or kill civilians.</p>
<p>The Heffernan family has filed a complaint under the Police Act. That case can go before the law enforcement review board even if charges are not formally laid against the officer (Grant 2016).</p>
<p>For Grant Heffernan there is only one appropriate outcome. That is to ensure that the cop cannot kill a third time. In his words: &#8220;The only way there is going to be any accountability and justice, is if the subject officer who killed my brother &#8230; faces criminal prosecution&#8221; (quoted in Grant 2016).</p>

<p>On Sunday, January 24, 2016, David McQueen, quadriplegic and wheel-chair bound, was shot and killed by Calgary police. In the days following the shooting family and friends remembered and mourned the loss of a dedicated dad and friend with a great sense of humor who dealt with sever health problems, often alone and abandoned by public health services.</p>
<p>Days after McQueen’s killing by Calgary police, one of his two sons, Justin McQueen, remembered his father as a dedicated and loving father. He also noted that his dad had been suffering from extreme loneliness in the period preceding his being shot by police. Justin McQueen was three when his father suffered the spinal injury that left him quadriplegic.</p>
<p>Justin McQueen recalled his dad: &#8220;He was an awesome dad. He didn&#8217;t act as though he had the accident. He played sports, he took us fishing” (quoted in Wiebe 2016).</p>
<p>According to the son the health issues and effects of the injury eroded his father’s well-being over time. The situation degraded as his frustrations with unresponsive or underresponsive governements and public health care systems grew. Justin McQueen notes that his father was never provided with proper home care and his expressions of depression were ignored and untreated (Wiebe 2016). Justin McQueen recalls: &#8220;He was suffering. He was pretty much left in that house and screaming for help and nobody would help him&#8221; (quoted in Wiebe 2016).</p>
<p>Among McQueen’s closest friends was former NHL gaolie and longtime hockey broadcaster Kelly Hrudey. Hrudey sought out McQueen after reading a story about the Calgary father who was selling flowers from a cart to support his children after being paralyzed in a diving accident at Sikome Lake in 1994. McQueen’s son, Justin, remembers Hrudey helping his family, recalling: “Kelly was my dad’s best friend” (quoted in Ho 2016).</p>
<p>Hrudey remembers going to meet McQueen after reading his story: “I went down there to visit anonymously. I didn’t tell him who I am or what I do or anything. I just sat there and chatted with him. He had a great sense of humour, he loved to laugh, he was engaging” (quoted in Ho 2016). From there an ongoing friendship developed. The two often got together to chat over lunch.</p>
<p>McQueen’s existing frustrations with government, healthcare services, and police intensified following the death of his beloved companion and service dog, Bear, earlier this month. This left McQueen feeling abandoned and alone according to those who knew him. Recalled Justin McQueen: &#8220;It was his absolute best friend. It was his only best friend&#8221; (quoted in Wiebe 2016).</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news that McQueen had been shot and killed by police, Hrudey reflected on his friend’s suffering and the need for access for mental health supports: “It’s terrible. He was everything you wanted in a friend. Unfortunately, and we’ve seen it with a lot of people with mental health issues, it can be completely debilitating. That’s why we need to talk and find the help everybody needs” (quoted in Ho 2016).</p>
<p>Hrudey, whose daughter has dealt with mental health struggles, spoke of the need for social openness in addressing mental health: “I just know that when Dave was well and functioning in society, he was just so proud of what he was accomplishing. Those were the good days. It’s important we talk about mental health because Dave was more than what happened” (quoted in Ho 2016).</p>
<p>As is becoming all too frequent in the Canadian context, people struggling with mental health issues are subjected to often lethal intervention from police. Rather than supportive public health services, which are slow to come if at all, the response of police is quick and brutal. Of course an agency designed and organized for compliance and control, to putting down public signs of difference, are not at all suited to addressing mental health needs.</p>

<p>The Calgary man shot and killed by in the city’s Huntington Hills neighborhood was 53-year-old David McQueen, a quadriplegic. McQueen was killed by Calgary police on Sunday, January 24, 2016, after what was reported as an hours long standoff. More than a dozen officers, including tactical team members, responded to the situation in the northwest neighborhood at around 4:40 PM. McQueen had experienced years of neglect, marginalization, and lack of support from various levels of government and the health care systems following a spinal injury suffered in an accident that left him quadriplegic in 1994. The victim had actively sought to improve his life situation and actively sought support from government and social service and health care agencies, with repeated lack of proper assistance over decades. Police shot McQueen immediately as the man exited his home in his wheelchair. Police said he had a handgun which had been fired in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>There was at least one person who was familiar with and cared about David McQueen’s situation. Unfortunately she was barred by police from speaking with him in the moments before he was killed by police. McQueen’s longtime caregiver, Isabelle Templeton, was talking over the phone with McQueen even as police surrounded his house. Templeton went to the scene and tried to talk with McQueen directly but was prevented by police. She heard the shots that killed McQueen while she was there on the street. In her words: &#8220;We heard the shots fired. We heard when we were sitting out on the street talking to the police officer. We didn&#8217;t know what was happening, but we knew something was going on&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>Templeton related to reporters that McQueen used to call her his &#8220;Calgary mom.&#8221; She affirmed that the victim was a &#8220;very gentle and very caring man&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016). Templeton had no guess as to what, if anything, might have finally pushed McQueen over the line into more public expression of frustration. In her recollection: &#8220;Nothing like this ever came up. I just don&#8217;t know what triggered it&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016). At the same time she did acknowledge that McQueen had experienced a great deal of suffering with little to no support from public officials or the health care system. In her view: &#8220;Something did [break], but I think a lot of it was pain. Just pain. He was in so much pain&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016). In the end, “He just got kind of desperate” (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>Templeton acknowledged that McQueen was particularly frustrated with the healthcare system and the government, with apparent justification. She noted that he was stuck in a broken wheelchair and left alone without proper homecare. She also confirmed that McQueen was angry and distrustful of police based on the character of their interactions with him. Again she concluded: &#8220;I think he just got kind of desperate. I don&#8217;t know. I know I was getting desperate, just going to see him, and there was nothing you could do&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>McQueen had appeared in a video for Easter Seals as part of one of the agency’s campaigns. He appears in the video along with his beloved dog, his main companion. A spokesperson with Easter Seals Calgary, Stephanie Rosch, acknowledged that she knew of McQueen and confirmed that the video was filmed as part of a public-service announcement in 2009 (CBC 2016). Easter Seals Alberta CEO, Susan Boivin released a brief statement: &#8220;We are very saddened to hear the news of the passing of Dave McQueen. He was a former client of Easter Seals&#8217; Equipment and Support Services program, but we have not had any contact with him for many years&#8221; (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>McQueen&#8217;s had long documented the lack of support and what he experienced as mistreatment on behalf of the federal and provincial governments, and the healthcare system. His Facebook page contains numerous, lengthy posts detailing his experiences of injustice. McQueen describes how he suffered a spinal injury after diving into Calgary&#8217;s Sikome Lake in 1994, not realizing how shallow the man-made body of water actually is. He outlines his subsequent, unsuccessful attempts to sue the Alberta government over his injury (CBC 2016). Far from receiving support, several of McQueen&#8217;s publicly available Facebook postings suggest that he had come to believe that his computer and phone were being monitored by the authorities. McQueen posted that police had targeted him in the past and he expressed anger at how he had been treated by them.</p>
<p>Alberta Liberal Party leader David Swann released a statement in response to the killing reporting that McQueen had &#8220;reached out frequently&#8221; to his constituency office. He noted that McQueen was always polite. Swann suggested that McQueen’s story was one example of the numerous cases of people falling through the cracks in Alberta. Yet he does not seem to recognize his own possible role in that given the fact that McQueen had contacted his office frequently looking for assistance. Swann did say in his statement on McQueen: &#8220;He was suffering from an obvious, and serious, mental illness and it was often difficult to understand where he was coming from or how we could help.&#8221; According to Swann this is another example, if an extreme and violent one, of the great need for changes to the system. Wrote Swann: &#8220;David was also angry. Angry with the injury which all but paralyzed him, angry with a system he felt failed him, and angry with those who represented that system.&#8221; That includes police whom he felt had targeted and mistreated rather than helping him. This in a health care context requiring supportive rather than police services in the first place. Swann’s statement concluded: “My thoughts are also with those, like my staff, who interacted with Mr. McQueen and are left, today, feeling they could have done more.&#8221;</p>
<p>On January 15 McQueen posted that his main companion, his dog had died. The post goes on to outline his anger over Calgary police and a Calgary politician, as well as his neighbours who may have been responsible for police interactions with him. Templeton notes that the death of his dog was devastating because it increased his loneliness and lack of companionship. Incredibly, Templeton suggested that healthcare workers would not visit McQueen because of his dog.</p>
<p>The police killing of David McQueen must be contextualized within the apparently growing trend in Canada of police involved killings of people experiencing mental health crises or distress. While statistics have not been kept in a systematic or reliable manner in Canada, between 2004 and 2014, the percentage of those cases of police killings of civilians involving people in mental crisis grew: they now account for about 40 percent of civilian shooting deaths at the hands of police (Firsthand 2016). Researchers for the documentary film Hold Your Fire report that in 2014, Toronto police answered 20,000 interactions involving people in mental crisis while Vancouver police say they respond to nearly 30,000 calls each year involving people experiencing mental illness (Firsthand 2016).</p>
<p>Reasons for the apparent growth in police involved interactions, and lethal interactions, with people in mental health crisis are numerous and include economic crisis which spurs emotional crisis for more people; lack of proper and adequate community health services (and government cuts to services in the context of austerity regimes that target programs of need to the working class and poor for reduction or elimination), and; law and order and broken windows policing regimes that send police first to deal with any social disturbance. Even more, commentators like the producers of Hold Your Fire suggest that the real reason for more lethal actions undertaken by police in addressing people dealing with metal health crisis (and often police kill people upon first sight of the victim, often within one or two minutes of encounter) is improper, inadequate, outmoded, and regressive police training. This more than anything else (Firsthand 2016). We might suggest, however, that this is built into the very structure of the police as an institution of violence, repression, domination, and control.</p>
<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) is investigating as is policy in Alberta when police are involved in incidents resulting in injuries or fatalities to civilians. Yet there is reason for concern about the investigation given statements made by Calgary police Chief Roger Chaffin following McQueen’s killing by police. Chaffin said he expects the shooter&#8217;s motivation to be addressed as part of the investigation. The chief also, not surprisingly, stood by the actions of the officers responding to the incident despite the fact that no investigation has been conducted or completed. And despite the fact that the victim was quadriplegic and confined to a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Chief Chaffin also reported that McQueen was known to police but did not suggest that this was related to any wrongdoing on behalf of the victim. Indeed he had to admit that none of the visits to McQueen’s home involved anything of a criminal nature. Such statements about victims being known to police is a common tactic used by police in Canada to cast aspersions toward victims and to damage their reputation publicly, or suggest without evidence that they have a criminal history and are, therefore, less deserving of public sympathy. Often victims are known to police only because of a dubious stop by police without cause, as in cases of “carding,” or because the victim actually called police for some type of support or assistance. In fact a search of court documents by reporters found that McQueen had no criminal record in Alberta. According to Chief Chaffin the Calgary Police Department is and was concerned with the well-being of their officers first and above all else.</p>

The Surrey Now-Leader reported that an autopsy found Woodhouse died from heart disease, and an investigation cleared officers of any wrongdoing in the death.",Deadly Force (2018); Deadly Force (2020),
0105-V1,"Police were investigating Devon LaFleur in connection with a stolen vehicle and an armed robbery, and his parents had reported to police that a pellet gun was missing from their home, an independent investigation found. Police confronted LaFleur in a cab and when he raised a gun, three officers opened fire. The gun he was holding was found to be an inoperable pellet gun. Friends and family described Devon as a gentle person who had struggled with mental illness since youth, according to news reports. The officers were cleared in the incident.
<p>Devon LaFleur, a young man struggling with mental health issues, was killed by Toronto police who had been informed of his mental illness and of the fact that the “weapon” he held was a broken pellet gun that did not work. His family had shared that information with Ottawa police who contacted Toronto police about the young man. Still police rained down at least 21 bullets on him striking him eight times. On June 6, 2017 the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) ruled, incredibly, that despite this Toronto police were “more than justified” in killing LaFleur. <em>More than justified</em>.</p>
<p>Rena LaFleur, Devon LaFleur’s mother, attributes the killing of her son to a failure of communication by police and inadequate, improper, or insufficient training of police in interacting with people experiencing mental health issues. LaFleur had schizophrenia and was apparently not on his medication the night police killed him.</p>
<p>According to Rena LaFleur, police disregarded the information they had, instead choosing to take a typically aggressive and confrontational approach with the young man. In her words:</p>
<p>“They created a situation in which they were confronting [him]. I can’t see how they can possibly justify that that is a viable mental health protocol. It&#8217;s shameful. I find it&#8217;s just a shame and many more people are going to die, especially the most vulnerable people in our communities” (quoted in 2017).</p>
<p>Rena LaFleur reveals that she had spoken with police about her son’s situation and there was a plan to have plainclothes Toronto officers attend the home of a friend with whom Devon LaFleur was meeting. She suggests: “They had a lot of time. They had what seemed to be a good plan in place and they changed it at the last minute” (quoted in 2017). She does not know why.</p>
<p>What did happen is that four uniformed police officers arrived at the friend’s house in marked cruisers. Officers yelled at the distressed man throughout the encounter and drew their guns on him. According to the SIU one officer fired 12 to 13 shots, the second fired eight to nine shots, while the third fired one bullet.</p>
<p>Sascha LaFleur, Devon LaFleur’s sister suggests: “So how do you say [we’ll shoot] to somebody who’s in psychosis, that believes that the angels will protect him from the bullets. You’re provoking him. There needs to be other methods of de-escalation, not lethal force, because you can’t come back from that” (quoted in 2017).</p>
<p>As Rena LaFleur puts it, painfully directly: “He didn’t have to die” (quoted in 2017).</p>

<p>As documented through this project, police in Canada have a brutal tendency to deploy quick, lethal force against people dealing with mental health issues. Too often police rather than health care providers are dispatched to encounter people in distress. And routinely they show up ready, even predisposed, to kill. And there is no consequence for their doing so.</p>
<p>Devon LaFleur, a 30-year-old man struggling with mental health issues was shot multiple time by Toronto police on March 4, 2016 outside a house on Bayview Avenue near Steeles Avenue East. More than a year later, on June 6, 2017 the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) let off the cops who killed him. A press release from SIU director Tony Loparco states the agency’s conclusion that the killing was justified. Such is becoming standard practice for Loparco and the SIU.</p>
<p>Toronto police had been tipped off to look for LaFleur by Ottawa police who informed Toronto police that he may be holding a weapon, which they knew to be a pellet gun. Four officers confronted the victim as he exited a cab with a friend. Three of the officers started shooting at him, hitting him eight times. He was taken to Sunnybrook Hospital where he was declared dead. The item he held turned out to be a CO2 pellet gun, as Ottawa police had suggested.</p>
<p>This project has recently documented the fact that Toronto police are developing a habit of shooting and killing people said to be holding pellet guns. No explanation is given by the SIU how it is justifiable for police to shoot someone multiple times, killing them, when it is known ahead of time they are only holding an air gun. And none is really required. The state protects the state in cases of police killings of civilians.</p>
<p>Incredibly SIU director Loparco makes a claim that, echoing police propaganda, suggests that being someone experiencing mental health issues itself made LaFleur a threat. In Loparco’s stunning words: “As soon as the man exited the vehicle, he posed a threat to the officers present.” This reflects the police view of people struggling with mental health issues. That the SIU director would take such a position is telling.</p>

<p>Police in Canada have an alarming and dubious record of killing people who are apparently struggling with mental health issues. Late in the evening of Friday, March 4, 2016 the Toronto police, among the forces most notorious for executing people with mental illness, killed again. The victim, not identified by police, has been identified by family as Devon LaFleur, an Ottawa resident said to be struggling with mental health issues. According to family, who reported LaFleur missing on Friday, he had been suffering with bipolar disorder. The young man was shot multiple times and killed in front of a women’s shelter where he had gone to visit a friend after travelling to Toronto.</p>
<p>According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), Ontario&#8217;s police watchdog, officers shot the 30-year-old man in front of a building on Bayview Avenue, south of Steeles Avenue East, in North York around 10 PM Friday evening. The victim was taken to Sunnybrook Hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>According to SIU spokesman Jason Gennaro a dozen officers were on the scene at the time LaFleur was shot and killed. According to the SIU three officers fired shots at the victim resulting in his death.</p>
<p>LaFleur’s aunt, Janet Page Andersen described her nephew as having a “lifetime of trouble” and said he did not like taking his medication because it left him feeling “dumbed down” (a rather common concern people experience) (quoted in Doucette 2016). Andersen also described LaFleur as a “sensitive, joyful person” who was loved by many people, despite the struggles he endured (quoted in Doucette, 2016). She reflected on her nephew in these terms: “He’s a sensitive, joyful person and who loved nature and trusted people” (quoted in Laucius 2016).</p>
<p>Sadly emblematic of his caring nature, LaFleur may have been killed while trying to help a friend. According to Andersen, the family believes Devon LaFleur travelled to Toronto in the first place because he wanted to comfort a female friend who was staying in a women’s shelter (Laucius 2016).</p>
<p>Malcolm LaFleur, traveled to Toronto and spent Saturday scouring the area where police killed his son in a desperate effort to find out information about the lethal confrontation that left his son dead. According to Andersen: “My brother is devastated. Police aren’t telling him anything” (quoted in Doucette 2016).</p>
<p>Unconfirmed reports by police suggested that LaFleur had earlier robbed a bank in Ottawa. His father had told police that he had no weapon but an air gun and made clear it was not a real firearm. According to Andersen: “He has had a hard time of it. But he had an air gun. He was not a dangerous man” (quoted in Doucette 2016).</p>
<p>A lover of nature and the outdoors, LaFleur had recently visited the West Coast and was looking to move to Vancouver Island with his father. Images he posted online showed photos of seals, seabirds, and himself hugging a massive tree. On his Facebook page he described himself as a “lost boy” (Doucette 2016).</p>

When two officers made eye contact with someone matching the description, Wettlaufer turned and walked away.

Wettlaufer told police the armed man was named Alex, and gave them a description and contact number for him.

When he turned and pointed a “convincing imitation firearm” at the officers, three of them opened fire. It was later determined to be a BB gun. An independent investigation cleared the officers.
<p>Based on the outcomes of several recent coroners’ inquests and investigations by oversight agencies it appears that the “suicide by cop” excuse is being used to let killer cops off the hook in various jurisdictions in Canada. It is becoming a “go to” justification for killer cops. The numerous problems with this bogus conclusion have been outlined in several reports for this project.</p>
<p>On May 16, 2017 the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) in Ontario added to the suicide by cop chorus legitimizing police killings of civilians in the case of the killing of 21-year-old Alex Wettlaufer by Toronto Police on March 13, 2016. Wettlaufer was shot three times while isolated in the Villaways Park in North York after a lengthy standoff in which it seems clear police had multiple opportunities to use non-lethal means and/or have a health care provider attend.</p>
<p>Two 911 calls apparently made by Wettlaufer suggested he needed health care assistance. Yet no health care personnel were dispatched to the scene. Only police. And they waited for the Toronto Police Emergency Task Force (ETF) to arrive. Wettlaufer was said to be holding a cell phone and a BB gun.</p>
<p>The claim of suicide by cop is especially dubious in this case given that on at least one occasion during the interaction with police Wettlaufer tried to get away by fleeing into the woods at Villaways Park. Police pursued him seemingly cornering him. By the SIU’s own account Wettlauufer even put down his BB gun several times. During the standoff the young man was alone on a bridge in the park. It is not clear that he posed any threat to the public at that time. By the SIU account, ETF had taken cover in the woods, being able to see Wettlaufer isolated and alone on the bridge. He was also apparently on his cellphone with 911 and expressing his distress during the standoff. And still no health care providers were deployed. So police, in positions of cover, shoot a distressed youth, on the phone with 911, who is alone on a bridge, and who has repeatedly set his BB gun down. And this is “suicide by cop.” The leap of logic by SIU director Tony Loparco is perplexing. In his conclusion: “ “Given that Mr. Wettlaufer was no doubt aware that he had a mere BB gun in hand, his actions lead me to the conclusion that he was attempting to bait the police into fatally shooting him by creating a perilous situation.” Quite a claim.</p>
<p>The three officers who killed Wettlaufer did not participate in the investigation as is their right under the limited and insufficient oversight rules. The investigation took fourteen months despite the SIU goalpost of 120 days.</p>
<p>As a  result of the SIU report no charges will be laid against the three officers who opened fire on Wettlaufer.</p>

<p>When Toronto police pointed their guns at Alex Wettlaufer, the 21 year old was alone, isolated, and afraid. His family heard his fear as they spoke with him by phone moments before he was fatally shot by police.—Paramedics were called to the scene at 11:34 PM. Taken to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Alex Wettlaufer would die of his wounds in the early morning of March 14, 2016.</p>
<p>Police were reportedly responding to reports of two men fighting at the Leslie subway station in the late evening of March 13. How this would lead them to confront and kill Alex Wettlaufer in a park, Villaways Park, blocks away is not readily known.</p>
<p>What is known is that police claims about the confrontation, and the claim that Wettlaufer had a weapon, do not mesh with what family members heard over the phone as the young man plead with police to lower their weapons.</p>
<p>Wettlaufer was speaking with his family by phone moments before he was fatally shot by police. According to his mother, Wendy Wettlaufer: “He was crying, saying that he’s being surrounded. They kept telling him to put the weapon down, and he kept hollering telling them he didn’t have a weapon” (quoted in Wilson 2016)</p>
<p>According to his sister, Melissa Wettlaufer: &#8220;He told them it was just a phone, but they shot him anyway” (quoted in Gillis 2016). His loved ones heard him tell the police he only had a phone and try to get them to put their guns down.</p>
<p>Responding to police claims, the victim’s mother said: “Alex does not carry a gun, he’s never had a weapon, and he (doesn’t) own a weapon” (quoted in Wilson 2016).</p>
<p>His sister insisted that her brother had a lot to look forward to in life and would not have jeopardized it by challenging police. Not while he was waiting on word of his acceptance into the army, hoping to follow in the footsteps of his late father “Shorty.” In his sister Melissa’s words: “He is not really a fighter and he wouldn’t have turned around and ruined everything because he was going into the army&#8221; (quoted in Wilson 2016).</p>
<p>People who knew the young man agreed that they knew him as someone who worked hard at school. He was described as being serious in his approach. Alex Wettlaufer’s sister-in-law put it like this: “He was the one no one worried about” (quoted in Campbell 2016).</p>
<p>Wettlaufer’s brother noted that his younger sibling worked in a factory and had never had any run-ins with the law prior to being shot and killed by police. His brother described him as a quiet man who did not even use social media. He believed he had never touched a gun (Campbell 2016). According to his brother, who preferred not to be named: “He kept to himself and was never in trouble” (quoted in Campbell 2016).</p>
<p>A neighbor, Lilieth Rankine, who has known the Wettlaufer family for years, and lives in the same housing complex on Leslie north of Sheppard, remembers the victim fondly. In her view: “He’s a good kid, went to school, finished school. I don’t get it . . . What happened? Can you imagine what the community is going through?” (quoted in Gillis 2016).</p>
<p>Another family friend Diane Storm similarly remembered Alex Wettlaufer as focused with specific personal goals in life. In her words: “He was quiet, kept to himself … (he wanted) to get out of here, to get out of housing” (quoted in Gillis 2016). Storms suggests, ominously, that the stigma and attention that young men in the community receive from police posed ongoing, real, and potentially fatal barriers, for young residents. She suggests: “When you are trying to improve yourself, it doesn’t help when you have this stigma” (quoted in Gillis 2016).</p>
<p>Sadly, Wettlaufer was a classmate and friend of Sammy Yatim, a young man infamously shot and killed by police while he was completely alone and isolated on a Toronto street car. The officer who killed Yatim, James Forcillo was convicted of attempted murder in a curious verdict (“attempted murder” even though he actually killed Yatim) following a rare case of a police officer in Canada actually being brought to trial for killing someone.</p>
<p>The Wettlaufer family reported that their loved one was simply returning home after visiting his girlfriend at the time police confronted and killed him. His brother said he was walking through the park after taking his girlfriend to the subway station.</p>
<p>Family friend Diane Storms was shaken by the killing. She asks: “Can you imagine, talking to your child on the phone, then hearing gunshots? And then silence?” (quoted in Gillis 2016).</p>
<p>Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which probes incidents of death, serious injury, and allegations of sexual assault involving police, has been investigating the killing since Monday morning.  Four investigators and three forensic investigators have been assigned to the case.</p>

0109-V1,"Police went to the home of Sandy Tarzan Michel to arrest him following a report of a domestic dispute. Michel, armed with a machete, tried to leave through the back door, according to a review by the director of criminal prosecutions. When Michel ignored orders to drop the machete and walked toward the street, police tried hitting him with a vehicle to disarm him. When that failed, an officer fired four shots at Michel, who was later pronounced dead of his wounds at hospital. The prosecution review determined police acted reasonably and no charges were warranted.
<p>On April 6, 2016 Lac-Simon police shot and killed 25-year-old father of three Sandy Tarzan Michel, after first hitting him with a car. On Thursday, June 15, 2017 The Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions for the province announced its decision not to lay charges against the officers responsible. The Lac-Simon force was not investigated by an independent body but  rather by Montreal police who made the recommendation, not surprisingly, not to lay charges.</p>
<p>Four officers had been sent to Michel’s home, in the Algonquin community of Lac-Simon in western Quebec just south of Val-d&#8217;Or, apparently in response to a domestic call. Police claim to have approached Michel on the basis that he was known to them. The police report says Michel exited his house carrying a machete but notes that officers drove into him with their police car. No statement on whether or not this is standard and sanctioned police procedure. Yet the Montreal police did suggest that it was legal activity with which the Director agreed with. When this did not give them the desired result an officer fired four shots and killed the man.</p>
<p>Since this investigation was begun Quebec has established an oversight body the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations). Only two days before the Lac-Simon announcement, critics held a press conference claiming the BEI was neither transparent nor effective.</p>

<p>Police violence against indigenous people and communities remains the ongoing practice of settler colonialism within the Canadian state context. This includes lethal force. Yet systemic racism and colonialism are rarely addressed in investigations of police violence. Many officers are oblivious to the colonial histories of their own institutions. Many have no understanding of colonialism at all.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 6, 2016, Sandy Tarzan Michel, 25, was shot by police on a small Algonquin reserve in Lac-Simon in Abitibi-Témiscamingue about 500 kilometres northwest of Montréal. Shockingly, reports suggest the young man was first struck by a police cruiser and later shot several times by police. According to provincial police Sgt. Benoit Coutu, officers from the Lac-Simon force were responding to reports of a man allegedly brandishing a knife as he was walking in public (Canadian Press 2016).</p>
<p>Sadly Sandy Tarzan Michel is not the first member of his family to be killed by police. In January 2009 his brother, Johnny Junior Michel Dumont, only 19, was shot and killed by police in Lac-Simon. Strangely police also said that Dumont was holding a knife at the time they killed him.</p>
<p>The community, which has been subjected to police violence, confronted local police and tried to stop the entry of provincial police, the Sûreté du Québec, who were called to assist the local force. Residents apparently blocked the entrance of police vehicles. Three people were arrested by the police at the scene.</p>
<p>SQ spokesperson Sergeant Daniel Thibodeau used these words to describe the situation: &#8220;It&#8217;s a high emotion type of situation that this community is not used to dealing with &#8230; Incidents from the past have carried over so there&#8217;s a bit of a build of tension&#8221; (quoted in Shingler 2016). It is not likely that the “incidents from the past” referred to be Thibodeau include ongoing practices of systemic racism and colonialism.</p>
<p>Unlike in other provinces, including Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, there is no independent unit to investigate incidents in which police officers injure or kill civilians. Instead another police force is asked to investigate in such cases. In response to the killing of Sandy Tarzan Michel, Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux initially tasked provincial police with conducting the investigation into the situation resulting in this killing. This was surprising given that members of the Lac-Simon force had been n communication with provincial police the evening of the killing and had come to the assistance of the local force. The Sûreté du Québec had sent a dozen officers to lend a hand to the local force (CBC News 2016). Responsibility for the investigation was finally moved to the Montréal police force. In any event few would suspect a thorough and critical review into the case by any fellow force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community Not Cops</p>
<p>Provincial police have been given supervision of the territory as the investigations move forward. Incredibly the SQ asked members of the press to stay away from Lac-Simon while they investigate (CBC News 2016). Around 1,200 people live in the town.</p>
<p>The police officers’ association in Lac-Simon has taken advantage of the killings to call for still more policing resources in the area and has blamed what they call a “public security crisis” in the community. Yet community members refer instead to a public health crisis and speak to issues of health, economic inequality, and harm reduction.</p>
<p>Michel’s family has relied on the support and care of people in the small community after having two loved ones taken from them by police in strikingly similar fashion. They report that many have reached out to contact and support the family.</p>
<p>According to Judith Brazeau, the partner of Michel’s father: “We are living with our pain. We help each other a lot. If someone is hurting, there is always someone there” (quoted in Northcott and Laframboise 2016).</p>
<p>In a public show of support for the family and anger at the police violence inflicted on their community, around 100 people marched Friday afternoon, April 8, to protest the circumstances surrounding Michel’s killing by police.</p>

<p>Police killings of people apparently experiencing mental distress or ill health are becoming an all too regular occurrence in the Canadian state context. Indeed, numerous studies and inquiries note the alarming numbers of people dealing with mental health issues who are being set upon and killed by police forces at all levels and across the country. It is also true that these killings are taking place even as report after report calls for improved training for police in understanding and responding to people dealing with mental health issues, training in non-lethal interventions and suitable equipment, and most importantly alternatives to police in situations involving mental health emergencies. Still police are sent to intervene against people in distress and still people continue to be killed by those police.</p>
<p>On Monday, April 25, 2016, a 63-year-old man, identified as André Benjamin, was both tasered and fatally shot by Montréal police in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood. The victim was shot by police around 8 AM during a police intervention a few blocks away from the city’s iconic Olympic Stadium. He was taken to hospital where he was declared deceased. According to police reports, the Montréal police were called to an apartment block at Ontario Street and Sicard Street regarding someone in apparent psychological distress. The call was reportedly made by a family member of the victim (CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>Poignantly, the police shooting of André Benjamin comes a mere six weeks after a coroner’s report was delivered in the police killing of Alain Magloire, another resident of the city who was killed by police while suffering mental distress. Magloire was shot and killed by police two years ago near the city’s bus station (CBC News 2016). The coroner&#8217;s report did recommend the use of stun guns rather than service firearms by police but also called for more extensive and better training for officers in appropriate dealing with people experiencing mental health issues.</p>
<p>Alain Magloire’s brother, Pierre Magloire, expressed sorrow that another man has been killed by the Montréal police force. He sees training rather than equipment as key. In his words: &#8220;It makes me sad that someone, again, has been shot. It’s like I’m always asking for more [training,]. It’s not because you have a stun gun that everything will go away and everything will be fine&#8221; (quoted in CBC News 2016). The killing of André Benjamin confirms this in the most brutal terms.</p>
<p>As is the situation in Quebec, where there is no independent investigations unit that would examine killings by police of civilians in the province, the case has been turned over to another force, in this case the Sûreté du Québec (SQ), the provincial police force. The SQ confirmed Monday afternoon that a taser was deployed by police during the encounter. The victim was also struck by at least one bullet fired by police.</p>
<p>The Québec government has been criticized by the province’s Human Rights Commission for long delays in instituting an independent agency to investigate shootings, serious injuries, and deaths of civilians that involve a police officer. While the provincial government has voted to create an independent investigations unit it is yet to be operational three years after the vote was recorded (CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>Montréal police have a rather infamous history of lethal force. Annual day against police brutality events, held on March 15 each year, have origins in protests against the force. The protests were initiated in 1997 by the Coalition Opposed to Police Brutality and often involve direct action.</p>

0115-V1,"Police were responding to a call reporting Craig Andrew Ford was carrying a knife outside a restaurant, though he was not seen threatening anyone, the caller said. An independent investigation found that an officer confronted Ford and asked him to drop the knife. When a second officer arrived, Ford walked toward him with the knife extended. The officer who shot Ford twice was cleared by the investigation.
<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the body that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia, has issued its report on the June 14, 2016 police shooting of 49-year-old Craig Andrew Ford and, as per usual exonerates the RCMP officer responsible. The IIO reports that three officers responded to a call of a man walking outside a restaurant carrying a knife in the city’s Norwell Drive area. Notably, the IIO reports that the caller said the man did not appear to be threatening anyone.</p>
<p>The report says one officer first encountered Ford on Country Club Drive, behind St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church and he was allegedly  “walking purposefully” (though it is not explained what this meant exactly A second officer then arrived in a car. As Ford began walking towards the vehicle the officer shot Ford twice. There is nothing in the report to suggest how an officer inside a police vehicle was under any threat from a man allegedly holding a knife and nothing more. There is some hint in the report that police were attempting to imply the bogus and discredited &#8220;suicide by cop&#8221; excuse.</p>
<p>Of note, the IIO came to its conclusion despite that fact that the officer who shot Ford declined to provide a statement or his notes. One can ask how any “investigation” has any veracity or legitimacy when it is not mandatory for Mounties under investigation to provide information, not even their notes, or to be questioned. Such is the dubious and limited nature of so-called investigations of police who kill in Canada.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of this the IIO felt confident in declaring: “(The officer) had to act quickly to protect himself, and had little time to weigh his options. It was reasonable for him to shoot in defense.” Again, it is not clear how shooting someone armed with no more than a knife, who is several feet from the officer who is safely inside a police vehicle can be constituted as an act of defense. It is as if the IIO is writing the officer’s own exoneration note.</p>

Another officer arrived and immediately struck Abdi in the face and head, witnesses said.

An officer confronted Abdi outside his apartment, according to news reports, striking Abdi with his baton on the legs, arms and torso during the arrest attempt. Another officer arrived and immediately struck Abdi in the face and head eight times, witnesses said. An independent investigation resulted in criminal charges, including manslaughter, aggravated assault and assault with a weapon against one of the officers. The case is still being tried in court. The defence argued that Abdi was showing signs of excited delirium. The Crown argued that although Abdi was not taking medication for his mental health issues, he wasn't malicious, violent or dangerous. 
<p>There used to be an old saying, “Help the police, beat yourself up.” Now Michael Edelson, the lawyer for killer Ottawa cop Daniel Montsion, wants a court and the public to believe that the vicious beating his client inflicted on 37-year-old Abdirahman Abdi had nothing to do with killing him. Instead, he suggests Abdi died of a heart attack. And he apparently wants people to believe that, even if he did have a heart attack, a severe beating with baton by police did not play a part in it. So, according to copagandist Edelson, Abdi is responsible for his own death: not the brutal assault he was subjected to. Maybe he beat himself to death.</p>
<p>Edelson made these absurd and offensive claims in an attempt to move up the court date for officer Montsion. According to audio court transcripts from the October 20 hearing, Edelson suggested: “This is not a beating that caused the death of Mr. Abdi. Mr. Abdi died of a heart attack. That’s what killed him.” Montsion has been charged with manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon in the killing of Abdi in July 2016.</p>
<p>The lawyer’s request to move the trial date was denied. The 12-week trial remains scheduled to start in February 2019, which is almost three years after Abdi’s killing.</p>

<p>Observant commentators have suggested that police actually operate like a gang, closing ranks unquestioningly to support their own no matter how egregious the member’s actions may have been. While there is some truth in this, police are not quite like gangs in that they lack the honor of gangs who at least have some limits, some acts they will not tolerate among members. If anyone needs a case in point they need only look at the dubious activities of the Ottawa Police Association and Ottawa police officers in response to the killing of Abdirahman Abdi, a Somalian-Canadian man suffering mental distress who was beaten to death by Constable Daniel Montsion in July of 2016. Montsion had previously expressed a problem with a suspect who was Somalian.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, March 29, 2017, the first day of preliminary court procedures leading to Montsion’s trial for manslaughter, several Ottawa police officers wore blue and black rubber wristbands stating “United We Stand #1998.” The number printed on the band is actually Montsion’s badge number. The rubber band bracelets are being sold for $2 apiece with the money going to the Ottawa Police Association.</p>
<p>This open show of support for a killer cop whose brutal beating of the defenseless man was partly caught on video is a tasteless and provocative move in a context that is already heated and where community members have mobilized against racist policing. It is an arrogant move that is clearly an attempt to put pressure on the court even as police say they do not comment on cases before the courts.</p>
<p>Incredibly the cops are using the excuse that it is a measure to address the trauma officers face on the job. This is part of a growing campaign to pose police crimes as primarily being about traumas for officers who then need more public money and resources for support. Some paid “criminologists” are being mustered to lend a veneer of credibility to the trauma money appeals led by police associations. Those same bought “criminologists” show little to no regard for the victims of police violence.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Justice for Abdirahman Abdi campaign, William Felepchuk, calls the bracelets an “outrage.” He notes that the nature of the crime Monsion is accused of is severe and suggest the move is an interference in the criminal justice process. Felepchuk further notes that police would not be so welcoming of civilians wearing such arm bands in cases of someone accused of killing a police officer.</p>
<p>Police always have pressures, both overt like the arm bands and covert like implied non-cooperation with prosecution, to apply on broader criminal justice processes. One should not expect anything resembling justice from the state in its dealings with killer cops.</p>

<p>The killing of Abdirahman Abdi, a 37-year old Somali Canadian man, by Ottawa Police Constable Daniel Montsion on July 24, 2016, was a particularly vicious and brutal affair which sparked community outrage and a community movement for “Justice for Abdirahman.” Montsion repeatedly delivered heavy baton blows to the defenseless man. On Monday March 6, 2017 Ontario’s police oversight agency, the SIU (Special Investigations Unit) brought three charges against Constable Montsion: manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon. Laying of charges against police officers who kill civilians is a too rare outcome in Canada.</p>
<p>The lethal beating of Abdi, a man struggling with mental health issues, while neighbors called out for the officers to stop was partially caught on video. Neighbors looked out for Abdi who was well known in the community and informed officers of his mental health issues and likely fear and lack of understanding of police commands. They implored officers to back off the frightened man but the assault with baton persisted. Abdi was pronounced dead in hospital the following day but family members say hospital officials told them the man was dead forty-five minutes before he arrived at the hospital.</p>
<p>Constable Montsion is a member of the Ottawa police direct action response team (DART) which targets gang but was assisting on patrol when he killed Abdi. Montsion has been on desk duty throughout the investigation and is now scheduled to appear at the Ontario court of justice in Ottawa on March 29. A second officer, Constable Dave Weir was involved in the assault on Abdi but the SIU concluded he was only a witness officer.</p>
<p>As reported previously by killercopscanada Constable Montsion was policing a neighborhood of Somali migrants despite having a history of violence against Somali-Canadians. By his own admission he had “panicked” when faced with a suspect of Somali background in a case that might also have included the planting of evidence by police.</p>
<p>The police assault on Abdi began with a 911 call from a Bridgehead coffee shop in Abdi’s neighborhood in Ottawa. What happened there is still unclear but owner Tracey Clark says Abdi had made some customers feel uncomfortable or harassed. In her words:</p>
<p>“He would stand and stare at customers, or get a little bit too close, and we were beginning to hear from customers that it was making them feel uncomfortable. And so we had started to have those conversations where, ‘Are you aware of this behaviour, could we ask you not to do that?’ So there were some interventions like that that had taken place.” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 2017)</p>
<p>After leaving the coffee shop Abdi apparently attempted to return to his apartment three blocks away. On the way he was intercepted by police. One witness, Ross McGhie reports that Abdi appeared fearful of receiving baton blows from the officer who clearly held a baton, and as a result picked up a piece of foam from the street (Nease and Pritchard 2017). He held it over his head in a defensive, not offensive, posture.</p>
<p>At some point, at the corner of Wellington and Hilda streets near Abdi’s apartment, the first officer tried to grab Abdi who dropped the foam and tried to run to his apartment building on Hilda Street. The officer prevented this by striking Abdi a few times on his legs, arms and upper body according to the witness Ross McGhie (Rease and Pritchard 2017). The officer also shouted at the stricken man.</p>
<p>At that point a second officer, said to be Constable Montsion, arrived on scene in a cruiser. He apparently moved very quickly and aggressively against the victim. In the words of McGhie: “The officer emerged from that car very rapidly &#8230; pulled up right in front of the building &#8230; immediately jumped into the altercation and administered a number of very heavy blows to the head and face and neck of Mr. Abdi” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 2017).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Family lawyer Lawrence Greenspon noted that family members had to endure much during the lengthy SIU investigation. In his words:</p>
<p>“It’s been extremely difficult. You not only have the incredible grief that we really can’t understand unless we go through it ourselves, and I don’t wish that on anybody. You have this grief of losing a son, brother, and it’s magnified … the public light has been shining on this death, this tragedy, for eight months now.” (quoted in Nease and Pritchard 20017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenspon said that the family would likely be pursuing a civil lawsuit as well.</p>
<p>The SIU report is with Ontario&#8217;s attorney general, at present Ottawa Centre Member of  Provincial Parliament Yasir Naqvi but it is not clear if Naqvi will make the report public or not. This has been a case of great public interest and concern. More than is often the case in situations involving police killings of civilians in Canada.</p>
<p>The police killing of Abdirahman Abdi was the focus of important public mobilizations and campaigns, including mobilizations of “Black Lives Matter.” Large demonstrations calling for “Justice for Abdirahman” were held in Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto. #justiceforabdirahman gained much attention on social media.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Constable Daniel Montsion is one of the Ottawa Police Service officers who killed Abdirahman Abdi, a Somali-Canadian man well known and cared for in his neighborhood. Numerous witnesses to the police killing of Abdi have reported that the officers involved over-reacted with extreme violence against the man despite appeals from neighbors not to hurt the man who struggled with mental health issues which neighbors were aware of. So it is rather disturbing to find out that Constable Montsion was policing a neighborhood of Somali migrants despite having previously, by his own admission, “panicked” during a violent takedown of another Somali-Canadian man in the city.</p>
<p>News of this previous incident of panic in the presence of a Somali-Canadian man was released as part of a court decision acquitting Abdullah Adoyta, (25) on gun charges following an arrest by Montsion. Notably, the judge in that case raised concerns about the reliability of Constable Montsion’s sworn testimony regarding the 2014 police raid that resulted in the arrest of Adoyta. Ontario Superior Court Justice Marc Labrosse noted that Montsion’s story conflicted both with Adoyta’s account and with the testimony of a senior officer on key points (Dimmock 2016).</p>
<p>During the raid and arrest of Adotya, Montsion was one of seven Ottawa police officers to attend the apartment on a raid of supposed gang members. Montsion reported grabbing Adotya’s forearms, raising them up. He claimed that as he did so the man’s raised shirt revealed the silver grip of a semi-automatic handgun. In response to this Montsion said he “sort of panicked” and began kneeing the young man while taking him to ground on the floor of the apartment. Montsion said that in this he did not see the gun fall out and only found it after moving the man while on the floor. He specifically said that he saw the gun only after the man was in handcuffs.</p>
<p>Judge Labrosse did not accept Montsion’s stated version of events. On one hand, his story conflicted with the testimony provided by Sergeant Mark MacMillan. MacMillan reported grabbing the gun before Adoyta had been arrested. Notably MacMillan said that he was so fearful for officer safety that he grabbed the gun with bare hands rather than use gloves to preserve DNA and fingerprint evidence (Dimmock 2016). The judge rejected this also not accepting that officer safety in that case overrode the necessity to preserve evidence.</p>
<p>Even more, Labrosse found that the “manner in which (Adoyta) was taken down, with Const. Montsion raising Mr. Adoyta’s arms in the air and seeing the handgun in Mr. Adoyta’s waistline is difficult to both understand and accept” (quoted in Dimmock 2016). The judge found further that Montsion and MacMillan provided opposed views of the takedown of Adotya. While Montsion claimed a struggle, MacMillan suggested there was none, even telling the court that Montsion held the handgun casually. According to Labrosss: “This is inconsistent with the evidence that Const. Montsion was struggling with Mr. Adoyta” (quoted in Dimmock 2016).</p>
<p>Judge Labrosse concluded as well that Montsion had confused the large, silver Gucci belt buckle worn by Adoyta with a pistol grip. While Montsion claimed he saw a silver grip the grip of the gun provided by police was actually black. Montsion made no mention of a belt buckle.</p>
<p>For his part Adoyta reported that he did not reside in the apartment targeted by police but had merely been invited there by a tenant. He said that he complied with police but was grabbed by Montsion and knocked to the side of a couch. The officer yelled “gun” around ten seconds later and then started kneeing and punching him. It was only then, wth Montsion pulling his hair, that Adoyta saw a gun on the floor some foot and a half away from him (Dimmock 2016). He reported a real need to protect himself from Montsion, not resisting arrest.</p>
<p>Labrosse noted that Adoyta had not seen a gun on the floor before the police entered. Adotya did not suggest that the gun was planted by police. He did ask police to do a fingerprint test to show his innocence with regard to possession of the gun.</p>
<p>Others might wish to ask such a question of planted “evidence.” So too will people have to decide whether to ask about the circumstances of panic in Constable Montsion’s aggressive arrests of two Somali-Canadian men and what role racism or anti-Somali sentiment might have played in his behavior toward those men.</p>
<p>Constable Montsion is currently under investigation by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the oversight agency that investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in Ontario. Constable Dave Weir is also under investigation in the killing of Abdirahman Abdi.</p>

<p>The police violence inflicted on Black lives, the killing of Black people, in the Canadian context has received much less public attention, scrutiny, and response than in the United States. The everyday reality of police surveillance, harassment, intimidation, confinement, and brutality against Black people, Black communities, gives the lie to Canadian mythologies of tolerance, openness, equality, diversity. It also undermines assumptions of social peace within Canadian liberal democracy, showing the reality of a social war carried out against racialized, as well as poor, migrant, working class communities. Many across Canada are unaware of the violence routinely inflicted on Somali Canadian communities in cities like Ottawa and Toronto, for instance.</p>
<p>On Sunday, July 24, 2016, Ottawa police beat Abdirahman Abdi, a 37 year-old Somali Canadian man, so severely that he had to be placed on life support. On Monday, July 25, Abdi died of the injuries inflicted by officers.</p>
<p>Abdi was well known and liked among residents in his Hilda Street neighborhood, in Ottawa’s Hintonburg. He was described by neighbors as “peaceful” and “beautiful.” A familiar face to many in the area, Abdi was subjected to a vicious beating by police as they arrested him according to numerous witnesses (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was taken to Ottawa Civic Hospital and was on life support for more than 24 hours. According to a family spokesperson the hospital told them Abdi had already been dead for 45 minutes before arriving in the hospital’s care (CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>In a situation rare in the Canadian context, the two Ottawa police officers under investigation for Abdi’s death were identified within a day of his death. Unlike the situation in the United States, the names of officers involved in killings of civilians are rarely released unless there are formal charges laid and rarely are the officers named so soon after a killing. In his case the two officers have been identified as Constable Daniel Montsion and Constable Dave Weir. Weir is a patrol officer but Montsion, is a member of the direct action response team (DART) usually deployed against supposed gang members (Jay 2016). In video posted online Weir is the officer seen kneeling on the bleeding victim’s head.</p>
<p>The police killing of Abdirahman Abdi puts a spotlight on racist state violence in Canada. It makes clear, emphasizes, structures of cultural imperialism, social war, pacification. As numerous cases documented by killercopscanada it shows the everyday, regular, normalized character of police violence particularly as it is deployed against Black and Indigenous communities in the Canadian context (and this includes detention, incarceration, etc., the full extent of the criminal justice system). This is not an aberration or lapse or malfunction. It is the policing system doing as it was designed to do.</p>
<p>One thing that is changing, significantly, is the response to the police extinguishment of Black lives. The response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has shown forcefully the growing community strength and mobilization of collective strength to oppose police violence. The actions of Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman have ensured that this killing will not be treated in the way that so many before it have been. The police, and more importantly the society, cannot “simply move on.”  This is telling as it openly exposes the reality of police violence as well as organizing and acting to stop it. Even more it raises prospects for alternatives to policing as an institution itself and shows the community resources, connection, care that would be required to build alternatives. The community care, love and compassion, in Abdi’s neighborhood, expressed even in attempts to get the cops to stop their assault provides a striking counter-example to the invasive, angry, repressive, punitive approach of the Ottawa police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Police Killing of Abdirahman Abdi</p>
<p>Police supposedly were responding to a 911 call from the nearby Bridgehead coffee shop at 9:30 AM. The call apparently suggested a man was causing a disturbance and touching a woman at the café (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There is no suggestion that Abdi was the person referred to in the call but according to witnesses he became frightened by the arrival of police and fled the coffee shop for his apartment, the building in which the Somali migrant had lived since landing in Ottawa in 2009 ( Ritchie and Jackson 2016). There are terrible histories of police violence against racialized immigrants in the Canadian context. In major cities like Toronto and Ottawa Somali migrants have been subjected to racial profiling, targeted policing, intimidation, and violence.</p>
<p>Several neighbors, including friends and family of the victim, witnessed the brutal police arrest. Shockingly they suggested that Abdi was beaten after being handcuffed and restrained. Zeinab Abdallah, an older Somali woman who lives in the building where the killing took place described the situation in horrific detail. She was leaving the building as Abdi arrived pursued by police. The frightened Abdi called to her in Somali: “Sister, protect me from them. Zeinab, help me. Zeinab, help me” (quoted in Jay 2016).</p>
<p>Her terrifying account continues in detail of the awful assault:</p>
<p>“As I looked one side, I was shocked, since my looking to that direction coincided with the policeman hitting him with a stick, the very moment he held the door trying to get inside. He was fleeing the policeman and was trying to go inside the building. Having received the blow, he turned back and grabbed the policeman, they grabbed each other, two strong men, the policeman tackled him and threw him to the ground, hitting him repeatedly. And there was this cut here and his blood run on the ground. Then he started beating him hard with the object he was carrying, and when he did so, I pleaded with him to stop the assault, informing him that the man was mentally ill.” (quoted in Jay 2016)</p>
<p>In the view of Abdallah the police wanted their victim dead. Nothing less. They would not listen to her pleas that they stop. As she explains:</p>
<p>“I pleaded with him, ‘Please don’t beat him, please, he can’t listen, he don’t care.’ The other policeman joined him, they did whatever they wanted with him until he became incapacitated. I have never seen anything similar to the way they beat him with such malice, animosity and hostility. They simply didn’t want him alive, they wanted him dead.” (quoted in Jay 2016)</p>
<p>Another witness Ross McGhie described an officer in a DART vest (now identified as Montsion) delivering a number of very heavy blows to the victim’s head and face (Jay 2016). Witnesses suggest the DART officer, the second officer arriving, began hitting Abdi immediately upon his arrival on the scene.</p>
<p>One witness, Shukri Samater, reported that people were calling out to inform officers about Abdi’s health issues and language barriers as he was being handcuffed and struck by officers on the stone steps right outside the entrance to the building (Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Samater: “That was the most disturbing part of it all, what happened after he was handcuffed. “He was bleeding from the back of his head. He didn’t have a weapon, he wasn’t violent” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Samater reported seeing officers kneeling on the back of Abdi’s head. She said police deployed a substance she believed to be pepper spray before hitting the helpless man with a baton (Jackson 2016). According to Samater police told bystanders not to call paramedics for assistance (Lofaro 2016).</p>
<p>Abdi&#8217;s brother Abdirizaq Abdi described the scene of the assault by police after being alerted by a neighbor. In his words:</p>
<p>“I heard the screaming, and then I come out and I see my brother lying down, police hitting so badly. Like, I’ve never seen something like that in my life. All of them, they were on top of him. He was under [them] &#8230; they were hitting like [he was] an enemy. I’ve never seen something like that.” (quoted in CBC News 2016)</p>
<p>According to family friend Nimao Ali who recorded the aftermath of the assault: “It was devastating to see that he was bleeding, and as I looked at him he actually stopped moving. So I could see he stopped breathing. And it took a long time for the ambulance to come, and it&#8217;s really sad to see that” (quoted in Nease 2016a). The video she took shows the violence of the scene.</p>
<p>The words used to describe Abdirahman Abdi by neighbors are “pleasant,” “gentle,” and “non-violent.” Neighbors note that Abdi struggled with mental health issues and noted that language barriers may have kept him from understanding what police were saying to him. Residents alerted police to Abdi’s mental health issues and told them of the language barrier in an attempt to stop the assault, to no avail. According to Samater: “The community knows he’s not well. We try to protect him” (quoted in Jackson 2016). They maintained those efforts to look out for their neighbor in the face of unfolding police brutalization.</p>
<p>Family friend Nimao Ali described Abdi as a “beautiful soul” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). According to Ali: “He is a beautiful person. He was not 100 per cent healthy like us, he had a mental illness. He was the kind of man that when you walk into the elevator he will hold the door for you, always had a smile on his face” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Ali questioned the quick resort to brutal force by police. In her clearly stated perspective:</p>
<p>“[T]here’s times people have to use their common sense, and there’s times people have to be sensitive to other people, and there’s times that police officers — or anybody with guns and weapons — have to really consider: Is this person OK? Are they mentally ill? Are they running away? Are they threatening me? All the blood that he lost could have been saved for a matter of just really taking this calmly. Because everybody in the [neighbourhood knows him] and we never felt threatened by him.” (quoted in CBC News 2016).</p>
<p>The aftermath of the police assault was recorded by an upstairs neighbor and a 27 minute video posted online. It shows a bleeding Abdi handcuffed and laying on the ground. Another neighbor claims to have taken a video but has not yet released it in respect to the family (Ritchie and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>Leslie Emory, executive director of OCISO immigrant support services, of which Abdi was a client, recalls:  “He is very much a very present figure on the street. He walked a lot” (quoted in Ritchie and Jackson 2016). He was known in his own neighborhood. And people cared for him. He was regularly encountered, a neighborhood presence. Now gone.</p>
<p>Nimao Ali stated the horror felt by many neighbors. In her words:</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to say. It’s devastating. We know him, the gentleman. He has a mental illness, a very peaceful guy. I have children in the building and he walks around, he’s good with the kids, he’s good with all the neighbours, never a problem. And all of a sudden, that he’s bleeding on the front steps of our building and dying, it was a devastating thing to see.” (quoted in Nease 2016a).</p>
<p>The victim of police violence was clearly someone who was recognized, valued, appreciated in the neighborhood. And none of this community knowledge was held by police who are typically an outside, occupying and invading, force that has little understanding of or care for specific neighborhoods and their experiences, needs, or interests. Police rarely seek to know any of this.</p>
<p>Residents of this Ottawa neighborhood also know first-hand and intimately about the convergence of police violence, brutality, lethal force, and racism. Ali was strong in stating that it was the first thing that came to mind in this case. And sadly it is a lesson taught to children at an early age. As a matter of survival. As she reflects:</p>
<p>“I had my six-year-old when I was recording and it broke my heart. I had to cover his eyes with one hand while I recorded, and I’m thinking, ‘OK, what’s going to happen to him when he grows up?’ So it is a fear and it is something that needs to be addressed and it’s something we need to speak out about.” (quoted in Nease 2016a)</p>
<p>This is the reality for racialized people and communities in the Canadian state context. It is a reality the police, politicians, media, dominant cultural expressions seek to cover up, ignore, or deny. It is the reality that Black Lives Matter has so courageously, honestly, consistently brought into focus as the truth of Canadian social life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter supporter Hana Jama, as well a Somali Canadian with first-hand understanding of police treatment of the community, acknowledged the lack of complete details made public regarding the assault but rightly noted that “at the same time, we do know that the man who was beaten up by police was a black man, was a Muslim man, was a Somali man and was a mentally ill man” (quoted in CTV News 2016). These facts alone raise serious questions, in addition to concerns about the specific brutality exercised by police. According to Jama: “That should be enough to know that happened to him was messed up” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Another community advocate Alicia LeJour, of the organization No Justice No Peace, questioned the attempt by police and some media to use passive terminology to present what was an active act of violence, an attack, by police. In her view it was “clear that this man was in good condition until he came into contact with police and he was suddenly bleeding and on the ground. I’m not too sure how they classify that as a medical emergency as opposed to police brutality” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Not only community activists but lawyers have raised concerns about the police actions against Abdi. According to criminal defense lawyer Leo Russomanno this case looks to be another example, in a growing line, of police “resorting to excessive use of force” and “perhaps our frontline officers being inadequately able to deal with people with mental health issues” (quoted in CTV News 2016).</p>
<p>Similarly Ottawa lawyer Michael Spratt, who has experience in cases involving excessive police force (but is not directly involved with the current case) has expressed concern over what he has heard in early reports regarding this arrest. According to Spratt:</p>
<p>“There are often times injuries incurred trying to arrest someone in a dynamic situation, but the reports of gratuitous violence after handcuffs were placed on the individual [are] shocking and there can be no excuse for violence after the person is handcuffed and on the ground. The lack of immediate medical attention and the reports about the delays between when first aid was administered and when paramedics arrived is troubling as well. When a subject is detained and handcuffed and has been beaten into unconsciousness, there can be no reasonable reason why medical attention should be delayed.” (quoted in CTV News 2016)</p>
<p>On Tuesday, July 26, dozens of people attended Hintonburg&#8217;s Somerset Square to remember Abdi and celebrate his life (Aylward 2016). Messages were written in chalk on the pavement at the square proclaiming “Black Live Matter” and “#JusticeForAbdirahman.”</p>
<p>Community members expressed great anger at what they recognize to be an injustice carried out at the hands of police in their community (Aylward 2016). In the words of attendee Grace Main: “For me, this is a turning point in my trust in the police services. I have to change a lot of things about my understanding about what’s safe in my neighbourhood and this part of the world right now” (quoted in Aylward 2016).</p>
<p>This reflects an apparently growing shift in consciousness regarding police in the Canadian context a shift that is gaining public expression largely through the efforts of Black Lives Matter organizing. While police violence and lethal brutality are too often downplayed in Canada, or given less attention and sustained response than cases in the United States, racialized communities which are disproportionately subjected to police targeting, are mobilizing effectively to raise awareness and challenge police actions in effective, material ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigating a Killer Force</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police violence against civilians, is investigating the killing. The SIU has assigned five investigators and one forensic investigator to the case. The two Ottawa police officers named are the subject officers. Five other officers will be interviewed as witnesses. Anyone expecting a semblance of justice, or even minimal accountability, from the SIU will be disappointed. Despite the fact that the unit is held up internationally as a model for police oversight and accountability there are real limitations and documented problems with the SIU. These are related in part to the fact that police, and police associations (they are not unions) regularly interfere with, obstruct, intimidate, and confound SIU investigators and investigations.</p>
<p>Even as the SIU was starting its investigation the head of the Ottawa police association was attempting to skew the interpretation of events, deflect attention from police actions, and diminish police force racism. Not surprisingly association head Matt Skof is offended that issues of racism and race are even being raised. He has attempted to pose racism and racist policing as American issues (again attempting to buttress the Canadian mythologies). In his words: “I’m worried that the conversation is even occurring, to be quite candid” (quoted in Nease 2016b). Once again police and their associations seek to silence critics or simply concerned citizens from even discussing the issues. And this is the aim of their media campaigns and intimidation efforts. For Skof, racism and racist policing are not real, but simply rhetorical. Again, in his words: “That’s unfortunate that we’re seeing the bleeding of that very difficult rhetoric into Canada now” (quoted in Nease 2016b). Skof also finds it “unfortunate” that “this has become a conversation around a specific community” (quoted in Nease 2016b). The association attempts to pose racism and racist policing as simply rhetoric and apparently un-Canadian rhetoric at that. This is a common ploy for police associations in such cases. Unfortunately, it seems to be an approach that infects all levels of governance in the Canadian state context. The silence from politicians, particularly supposedly progressive ones, is telling.</p>
<p>Skof’s provocative and insensitive comments have drawn justified criticism. Amran Ali, active with the Canadian Somali Mothers Association, said in an interview with CBC News Ottawa responded:</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why he felt the need to do that. He could have simply said, he doesn’t need to give an interview, there’s an SIU investigation going on. But he felt it was OK for him, and appropriate, to go on air, and talk to Canada about how Abdirahman deserved what happened to him. Up until then, I was holding it together. &#8230; A loss is a loss, an individual’s life was taken, but up until that interview, I’m not going to say I was OK, but I was able to hold it together.” (quoted in Nease 2016b)</p>
<p>Skof spoke, as association heads do, to impact the public view of the police and to send a message to the SIU and politicians. Any efforts to address police violence will, of necessity, have to openly and aggressively challenge the police associations which are in many ways the hard edge of policing in social war.</p>
<p>The Ottawa police association has found it necessary to act to defend officers on several occasions recently. Numerous Ottawa Police officers have faced charges in the last few years.  Two officers were charged with assault when a man was injured while in custody in May 2014. An officer was charged with dangerous driving following a high-speed car chase that put a suspect in hospital in February 2015. Three officers were charged with criminal negligence and breach of duty for seriously injuring three paramedics during a training exercise in June 2014 (Haley and Jackson 2016).</p>
<p>On Tuesday, following Abdi’s death, the National Council of Canadian Muslims released a statement calling for a thorough investigation of the violent arrest (Jay 2016). As NCCM spokesperson Amira Elghawaby put it: “The community we’re hearing from here in Ottawa — and across the country — want answers. So it’s really important that the SIU conducts the investigation thoroughly, transparently” (quoted in Jay 2016). Unfortunately the history of investigations of police killings of civilians in Ontario as elsewhere in Canada leaves little reason for optimism that the police involved will be held in any way accountable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Already the response to the police killing of Abdirahman Abdi has a different sense than many acts of police violence in Canada recently. The mobilizations, including rallies, demonstrations, public gatherings, in the community and beyond show a rising movement against police violence. Calls that Black Lives Matter and #JusticeforAbdirahman galvanize opposition to police violence, and indeed policing more generally (as inherently violent institutions). The willingness of community members to speak openly and unflinchingly about police violence, particularly within a community subjected to and threatened by ongoing police violence shows the strength of solidarity and care. And this solidarity and care are based partly in the shared experiences of harassment, racism, brutality, and control directed by the state at Somali Canadian communities.</p>
<p>These mobilizations open real possibilities for opposition to state violence and for alternative, real, forms of community safety and security (which police do not provide, nor were they intended to provide, in any event). The neighborhood in which Abdirahmen Abdi lived shows the resources of care on which opposition and alternatives to police will be founded. A stark contrast to the repression and punitiveness of policing.</p>

",Deadly Force (2018); Deadly Force (2020),
0121-V1,"Responding a tip coming from the FBI about a terror threat concerning an ISIS supporter, RCMP and other law enforcement agencies surrounded a home where Aaron Driver lived with his sister. Reports said Driver had called a taxi to the house and was carrying a backpack when he got in. Police blocked the taxi and were preparing to make an arrest when Driver detonated the device. The taxi driver dove out of the car uninjured, but Driver was shot to death by a Mountie. A joint investigation by Ontario Provincial Police and local officers found no wrongdoing in the shooting.
<p>The killing of Aaron Driver by RCMP on August 10, 2016, in what police have claimed was an anti-terrorism sting has raised a number of serious questions about the nature of the RCMP operation, the police relationship with Driver beforehand, the timing of the police intervention, and the seriousness of the threat, if any, actually posed by Driver. The only information circulating publicly is based on the word of the police and the lone known witness the cabbie, Terry Duffield, called by Driver before the police ambush and in whose taxi Driver was killed by an RCMP bullet.</p>
<p>RCMP claim to have intervened against Driver on the basis of a tip by the FBI that someone in Canada was planning an imminent terrorist attack in a public space. Yet their actions in approaching and killing Driver call into question the response taken to what police are claiming was a real, imminent, threat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Manner of Terror Bomb Explodes Killing No One?</p>
<p>Police initially intimated that Aaron Driver had been killed by a bomb that he held and which he detonated upon seeing police approach the cab he was sitting in. Yet an autopsy released by Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), who are investigating the actions of the RCMP has apparently revealed that Driver was killed by police bullets. The autopsy showed that several police bullets struck Driver, piercing vital organs (Rieti 2016).</p>
<p>Aaron Driver’s father, Wayne Driver, reported that his son was killed by a police bullet that struck his heart. The supposed bomb he carried could not have killed him. According to Wayne Driver:  “It was the police officer’s bullet that killed him. The bomb that exploded he could have walked away from with minor to severe injuries they said” (quoted in Bell 2016a).</p>
<p>According to police Driver was even allowed to leave the vehicle after the explosion. In the words of RCMP Deputy Commissioner Mike Cabana: “Subsequent to that he came out of the cab and was standing up and was not following the direction that was provided” (quoted in Bell 2016b). And police had no opportunity to act before then given the imminent peril they claim?</p>
<p>This raises one rather large, fundamental, question. How could a bomb that was supposed to pose an imminent threat to broad public safety not be powerful enough to kill even the single person holding it on his lap? Now it is possible that Driver simply messed up in making it. It is also possible, especially given questions raised below about the police actions and the timing of their intervention that they had some knowledge of the bomb beforehand and had reason to expect that the bomb would do little or no harm. Perhaps because police had designed it and helped prepare it, as a dud, in much the manner they did for John Nuttall and Amanda Korody in entrapping that unfortunate couple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Danger to Whom?: Why Not Protect the Cabbie?</p>
<p>The Strathroy, Ontario, taxi driver in whose cab Aaron Driver was shot and killed would certainly like to know why the police did not act sooner to protect him and to intercept the supposed terrorist before he entered the taxi carrying what RCMP have claimed were two bombs. RCMP officers already had Driver’s home surrounded when Terry Duffield drove his taxi cab into the driveway around 4:30 PM. According to police they swarmed the cab within seconds of Driver entering the back seat. Police claim that with the approach of police Driver detonated one explosive. RCMP claim that it was only in response to that detonation that they shot and killed Driver. In addition to the questions about the nature of a bomb, and its potential to cause mass harm, which could detonate in someone’s lap and not even kill that person directly, there is the question about why police waited, if they really believed Driver carried a serious bomb that posed substantial threat, until he was inside a car with an innocent bystander before approaching him. Why would they give him a chance to detonate the supposed bomb or bombs at all?</p>
<p>For his part Terry Duffield is furious with how police acted, risking his life if their account is true, and is promising legal action against the force. Duffield claims he is still dealing with the shock of that morning’s events and is taking medications for the resulting back pain and stress. In his words: “There will be legal action taken on this. They put my life in jeopardy” (quoted in CBC News 2016). Duffield, like many observers, is perplexed, to say the least, that police, if they really believed they were dealing with a terrorist carrying explosives and out to launch an “imminent attack,” would not stop the suspect before he put a bystander’s (the public’s) life in danger.</p>
<p>In Duffield’s view, police could have and should have done more to protect him than they did. In his words:</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t think police handled it very well at all. They did absolutely nothing to help me. At no time did they try to warn me. At no time did they try to stop my vehicle from entering the address…This gentleman was allowed to walk in front of my car, down the side of my car, get in my car and all of these sharp-shooters, all these SWAT teams and all these people who were supposed to be around, nobody did anything until after the bomb went off.” (quoted in CBC News 2016)</p>
<p>This raises real, significant, questions. It makes the critic wonder if police had reason to believe that Driver’s bomb was a phony, incapable of exploding, much like the one that RCMP helped to build for John Nuttall and Amada Korody in their infamous entrapment case of two poor, marginalized, people dealing with addition and mental health issues in Surrey, British Columbia three years before the river case. Perhaps police believed the bomb was no bomb at all (because they had assisted in or directed its’ making). Perhaps the cabbie was part of the public anti-terror takedown gone wrong (there is no evidence of this at this point and Duffield would seem sincere in his claims). In initial reports it was said that Duffield jumped from the taxi before the bomb was detonated. More recent reports (CBC News 2016) say that police ordered him to leave the car after the bomb had already been detonated.</p>
<p>Duffield had a follow up interview with police and specifically asked why the force did not offer him any protection in their operation that morning. The cabbie remains dissatisfied that police offered him no explanation. The public seeks one as well. Duffield, who has retained a lawyer and intends to pursue legal action, and curious observers alike, are left to ponder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintaining Secrecy and Unaccountability in Anti-Terror Cases: No Independent Investigation</p>
<p>Confounding all of this is the fact that there has been, and there will be, no independent public investigation into the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver and any or all of the questionable circumstances surrounding it. Provincial police have been tasked with the investigation into Driver&#8217;s shooting at the request of the Strathroy-Caradoc Police Service (Rieti 2016). The OPP and Strathroy-Caradoc police “continue to jointly investigate the incident” under direction of the head of the OPP’s criminal investigations branch. That is, the police, and only the police, are “investigating” the police in this case. That has been a consistent recipe for cover up, hush up, distortion, and distraction. And legitimation.</p>
<p>All of this is in keeping with the secrecy, lack of transparency, obfuscation, and disassembly that have been the hallmarks of anti-terror practices in Canada. This includes the secretive actions of the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the Communications Security Establishment Canada (Canada’s NSA) as well as notorious instruments like security certificates which violate all notions of due process and allow for the state to detain people for indefinite periods while subjecting then to “trials” without disclosure or even a reading of charges against them, ad without proper representation or defense.</p>

<p>The shooting and killing of Aaron Driver (24) by RCMP in Strathroy, Ontario on August 10, 2016 has, as expected, served as a launching point for a variety of government trial balloons on increasing and expanding repressive state policies and practices under the panic conditions of publicly stoked fear over domestic terrorism within Canada. Some of the early proposals from the government may suggest to the concerned observer the manifestation of a sequence on re-education or de-programing from <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>. In any event it is clear that the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver has served the function (perhaps intentional from the point of view of the state) of providing the necessary cover to bring forward a new regimen of repressive anti-terror governance and social regulation. Even as more questions are being raised by the circumstances of someone being killed for planning a terror attack despite the fact that the bomb he supposedly detonated on his lap was not strong enough to kill even himself (as this week’s coroner’s report showed Driver was killed by a police bullet as he was shot twice by police) (Ballingall 2016).</p>

<p>Fear Politics and New Regimes of Repression in Canada</p>
<p>The police operation that ended in the killing of Driver was carried out within a specific context of growing calls for review, revision, or repeal of the Canadian government’s controversial and widely opposed Anti-Terrorism Act (better known as C-51). The timing of the Driver killing, in a period of public review and criticism of anti-terror legislation is not unique. Indeed previous recent cases, such as the police shooting of supposed “lone wolf” Michael Zehaf-Bibeau at Parliament Hill in 2014 and the announcement of the arrests of John Nuttall and Amanda Korody in 2013 (in a case since ruled in court to be entirely police entrapment), occurred within a context of discussion over the Canadian state’s anti-terrorism regime and policies.</p>
<p>Jeff Shantz and Hisham Ramadan (2016) have outlined the political mechanisms by which fear is converted to repressive policy, particularly within the context of even events associated, even falsely, with (imagined) terrorism. Their discussions detail and explain the manipulation of state involved “terror plots” and the public discussion of responses (by police, courts, government) to them in dramatizing the need for more repressive regimes to address supposed “home grown terrorism.”</p>
<p>Only a week after the RCMP shot Aaron Driver, a young man already processed through the courts and released on an anti-terror peace bond restricting his movements and access to cell phones and the internet, and the federal Liberal government is already, again as expected, making noises about new repressive policies which would allow for increased surveillance as well as intrusive measures to control people’s “bad thoughts.”</p>
<p>In a presentation to the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in Ottawa, on August 17, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale revealed that the federal government is looking to make so-called counter-radicalization counselling mandatory for anyone under an anti-terrorism peace bonds. Notably, this provision has been part of C-51 but was struck down by a Winnipeg judge in the case involving Aaron Driver.</p>
<p>Goodale has insisted that a federal consultation on national security must be undertaken and he expects it to conclude by the end of 2016. Notably, Goodale has positioned this consultation as a means to innovate new repressive and intrusive measures rather than as a mechanism of ratcheting down anti-terror policies and procedures (such as ending security certificates which have been used to hold racialized, migrants under vague government claims of some association with terrorism, under conditions that violate due process or by abolishing the anti-terror list which is used to criminalize resistance movements that oppose ally states of the Canadian government).</p>
<p>Tellingly the Liberal government is using the police killing of Aaron Driver to openly promote the idea of counter-radicalization, which, in fact, they had raised before the Driver shooting and which had, at that time, raised obvious red flags for critics.  The federal government actually views the establishment of a federal office of counter-radicalization as a centerpiece of their anti-terror regime. The office of counter-radicalization would serve as “a national focal point for research, counselling and intervention services” (Bronskill 2016a). Goodale, in speaking to the chiefs of police re-stated the government’s prioritization of this center for controlling “bad thoughts” and re-education. And despite Goodale’s simultaneous claim that consultation and reflection are key to the government approach going forward he unapologetically presents this initiative as one that must happen without public consulation or review before the end of this summer. According to Goodale: “We are in the process of recruiting the person that will lead the effort. And we are determined to get this office up and running toward the end of the summer, the beginning of the fall. The incident is Strathroy demonstrates how very important this priority is” (quoted in Bronskill 2016a). Note that the police killing of Aaron Driver is openly asserted as the impetus for rushing the “bad thoughts” center into existence. Interestingly Goodale acknowledged that there had been efforts to de-radicalized or counsel Driver but they had not been systematic.</p>
<p>Goodale again referenced the Aaron Driver case, and what he supposedly represents, in justifying the de-radicalization, re-education center. According to Goodale, the government views as among its greatest security concerns the so-called “lone wolves” who are drawn to “extreme ideologies (Bronskill 2016a). In his words: “We need to understand what positive messages can counteract the insidious poison that draws people in, especially young people (quoted in Bronskill 2016a). No word from Goodale what the positive messages involve but one might guess from Liberal government practice they should include the benefits of war in Iraq and Syria and the selling of arms to the brutal terror regime in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Minister Goodale has also raised the prospect of putting people released on peace bonds under constant surveillance. He noted that Driver was not under constant surveillance, something the RCMP bemoan. According to Goodale:  “That is obviously a lesson that one needs to look at very carefully, as a result of the incident in Strathroy. And we are examining very carefully what we need to do to make our police and security activity more effective” (quoted in Bronskill 2016a). Again, we should remember that peace bonds can be and are placed on people under virtually no evidence at a threshold much lower than would ever lead to successful prosecution. So the real result of the government proposal would be to allow constant surveillance of people who show no or minimal signs of actually engaging in a terrorist act. Such would have been contentious to say the least before the killing of Aaron Driver. It is now a supposed necessity, a lesson learned from that case. Goodale refused to comment on whether surveillance has in fact been stepped up for the dozen or so people who are currently under anti-terrorism peace bonds (Bronskill 2016a).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn Over Your Password: Invasive Policing and the Terror Panic</p>
<p>Minister Goodale was not prepared to stop there however and has raised the prospect of giving police what they want in terms of invasive policing. In his meeting with the chiefs of police Goodale also gave notice that Canadians “need to think about how far police should be allowed to go in accessing their electronic devices and communications” (Bronskill, 2016b). Indeed, following the Driver killing, the government is going to use the occasion of a federal review of cybersecurity to discuss a proposal prepared by the country’s police chiefs for a new law that would compel people to reveal their passwords with the court’s consent (Bronskill 2016b).</p>
<p>At his meeting with police chiefs, Goodale “acknowledged that smartphones contain a wealth of personal data and can reveal much more about a person than an ordinary physical search might” (Bronskill 2016b). While conceding that people do value their privacy, Goodale also suggested that people would be willing to compromise that concern in order to give police more tools, particularly to pursue terror related activities. According to Goodale: “I think Canadians recognize the imperatives on both sides” (quoted in Bronskill 2016b). Yet this is not a matter of weighing equivalences. Either police have access to deeply personal private information or they do not. And one must always ask under what circumstances they gain access. Again, connecting this access to a peace bond would be connecting it to potentially nothing in terms of real evidence or legitimate concern. Civil liberties groups and privacy critics have suggested that such legislation would be unconstitutional (something that has certainly never deterred police chiefs or their supporters in government).</p>
<p>While the public has shown no desire for such legislation or interest in debating it, Goodale is using the Driver case to suggest that debate on this policy is now needed. According to Goodale:</p>
<p>“This is a critically important subject area, and one that — for one reason or another — has not been subject to adequate public discussion. I think over the course of the fall, it will. And that will help us as a government and it will also help police forces and security agencies to define the parameters.” (quoted in Bronskill 2016b)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never mind that there has been much public opposition to similar proposals from the former ruling Conservative government. He RCMP killing of Aaron Driver has changed the terrain of operations for the Liberal government. How fortuitous indeed.</p>
<p>Minister Goodale also used the occasion to raise the panic figure of the lone wolf in a basement. In his words:</p>
<p>“The hackers and scammers who are constantly trying to break into our information systems are a motley but potent combination of foreign states, militaries, terror groups, organized crime, petty thieves and vandals, and even that lonely computer geek in his underwear in the basement.” (quoted in Bronskill 2016b)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goodale also noted that this is also a real opportunity for investment or profit for small and large firms alike. Again this is a further convergence in the anti-terror trajectory of neoliberal accumulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>All of these utterances, musings, and proposals for repressive and invasive state policies and practices have been presented within the space of only a single week following the police killing of Aaron Driver. For those of us observing and commenting on government anti-terror regimes, fear politics, and state regulatory frameworks more broadly such moves by the government after the Driver killing were, far from being surprising, actually expected at least generally if not in these specifics (see Shantz 2016).</p>
<p>In this the police killing of Aaron Driver, within the context of an as yet unconfirmed attempt at terrorism, stands with other cases such as the Germinal collective set up in 2001, the Zehaf-Bibeau killing, and the Nuttall and Korody entrapment. We should expect that further, more extensive, invasive, and punitive policies and practices will emerge and be brought forward under the guise of public consultation (framed and shadowed by the Aaron Driver case). Such is the position of the killing of Aaron Driver within the manufacture of social phobias and fear in the current social and political context within the Canadian state (a state that is, remember, active in war).</p>

<p>Serious questions need to be asked in the wake of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) killing of supposed terror suspect Aaron Driver (24), shot by RCMP officers on August 10 following an apparent tip from the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). RCMP claim Driver detonated an explosive device in a cab and that he was killed because he had access to another device.  Among the questions that require answers are how someone who was on a terror peace bond which restricted his actions and access to the internet could compile information and materials to build a bomb and build it under such conditions. It must also be answered why someone under watch by RCMP as a terror suspect was able to leave his house with two supposed bombs with no intervention beforehand (and after the supposed tip was received).</p>
<p>These questions, and questions about RCMP anti-terror operations more broadly, are particularly pressing given that the killing of Driver comes within a month of a major court decision finding that the RCMP had entrapped two poor people, dealing with mental health and addiction issues, in a phony police created and directed “terror threat.” In that case the RCMP spent millions of dollars in labor and resource to target and prime two poor residents of Surrey, B.C., John Nutall and Amanda Korody, lavishing gifts and attention on them in an attempt to get them to go along with a fake terror plot instigated and planned by the RCMP. The court decision confirmed that the threat came only from the RCMP, who conceived it and provided all of the means to carry it out (the supposed bomb had no detonator), and who manipulated the reluctant and confused couple to go along, even as they offered resistance, for fear of losing the newfound benefits being provided by the RCMP (in meals, companionship, etc.).</p>
<p>Given this context the real, and fundamental, question is why anyone should trust and accept the RCMP version of events. This case has the markings of distortion and deception that mark other so-called anti-terror investigations in the Canadian state context from the Germinal Collective case (even before 9/11) to “Project Thread,” through the “Toronto 18,” to the entrapment of John Nuttall and Amanda Korody. In the Germinal Collective, “Toronto 18” and Nuttall and Korody cases in particular, the police were actively, centrally, involved in the instigating, planning, encouraging, and operationalizing of terror acts that were never carried out (and never would have been in the absence of police). As Shantz (2016) writes, these cases are primarily designed and carried out to give the police justification for continued or expanded resources and to stoke social fear, social phobias (particularly Islamophobia, fear of migrants, and fear of poor people).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Killing of Aaron Driver</p>
<p>The killing of Aron Driver by RCMP officers apparently began with a tip from the FBI that a person in Canada was possibly planning to carry out a terrorist attack. There have also been reports that the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), which operates the city’s subway, buses, and trolley cars, received a threat against the transit system. In response to the FBI tip, details of which are not known, the RCMP descended upon the home of Aaron Driver, a young man who had been arrested and released on an anti-terror peace bond for attempting to justify the actions of ISIS as acts of self-defense in a time of war. Driver had not been observed or charged for engaging in any activities related to terrorism. He had been targeted solely for his ideas and social media presence.</p>
<p>On the surface the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver, if one is to believe events as the police describe them, is fairly straightforward. On Wednesday, August 10, 2016, the federal RCMP converged on the house in which Aaron Driver was living in the community of Strathroy, a small city of around 20,000 people in southwestern Ontario. Sometime after 4:00 PM police observed Driver leave his residence and enter a taxi waiting in his driveway. Police report that shortly thereafter, as police approached the vehicle, Driver detonated an explosive device injuring himself and causing minor injuries to the taxi operator. The police also claim seeing a second device and responding by shooting Driver, killing him.</p>
<p>So far all of the details provided have come only from the RCMP who have been the only ones to claim to be witnesses to these events. Yet why should we believe the RCMP account? And what sorts of questions need to be asked about it? A closer look at the Driver case leaves many questions hanging in the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Punishing Bad Thoughts: The Aaron Driver Case</p>
<p>Of note, Driver had been initially targeted for punishment by police not for any suspected actions but simply for attempting to justify the actions of ISIS in online venues. That is, the police targeting of Aaron Driver was an early effort by the state to criminalize people simply for expressing “bad thoughts”—a repressive policy approach, in violation of civil and human rights, which Conservative and Liberal governments alike have pursued and sought to expand in the Canadian context (on the policing of bad thoughts see Shantz 2014).</p>
<p>Aaron Driver had come to the attention of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) in October of 2014 when he was reported to be tweeting support for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria under the online name of Harun Abdurahman. Driver had also justified the 2014 attack on a ceremonial officer at Ottawa’s War Memorial and run to Parliament Hill (seat of federal government) by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, as a military response to Canadian military actions in Iraq and Syria. For this Driver was arrested and brought before the court in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Driver was released on an anti-terror peace bond. Under its terms he was not allowed to associate with any terrorist organization and was under prohibitions against using a computer or cellphone. Driver was also required to live at a specified address in Strathroy, Ontario and to notify a specified RCMP sergeant should there be any changes in his address (Canadian Press 2016).</p>
<p>The peace bond allows for intermediate constraints on a person’s liberty on the basis of evidence that would not be sufficient to prove an actual terrorism offence (Forcese 2016). As one can see there are real spaces for abuse and unjust application with such an instrument. Indeed the court is unlikely to turn down any request by the federal government to apply an anti-terror peace bond.</p>
<p>And recall that John Nuttall and Amanda Korody, who had spent three years incarcerated under what was nothing other than an RCMP entrapment scheme, were re-arrested mere hours after being released following the finding of entrapment. That was clearly a punitive (and mean-spirited) attempt by the government, and RCMP, to save some face or recoup some losses.</p>
<p>After Driver&#8217;s killing his former lawyer, Leonard Tailleur, stated publicly that there was no evidence that the young man was in any way directly affiliated with ISIS or with any other supposed terrorist organization (Canadian Press 2016). He found the claims of police against Driver to not fit with the man’s character as he knew him. According to Tailleur: “It’s shocking. Absolutely shocking, actually. He was generally looked to be low risk as long as there&#8217;s certain things that had been dealt with” (quoted in Canadian Press 2016)</p>
<p>Tailleur suggested that the killing of Aaron Driver raises some significant questions. He notes that Driver was almost certainly under regular police surveillance (Canadian Press 2016). In Tailleur’s words: “If he was doing his thing, it was kind of ridiculous because I&#8217;m certain he was going to be under scrutiny beyond his peace bond. Police would always monitor his whereabouts &#8230; They&#8217;d make him a priority” (quoted in Canadian Press 2016). So how could he compile materials and instructions to construct two bombs? How could he leave his house with the two bombs in hand? Why was he not stopped before entering a cab and putting a cabbie at risk?</p>
<p>Even from a liberal perspective many questions arise from the killing of Aaron Driver. Legal scholar Craig Forcese outlines some of these:</p>
<p>“How did someone known to authorities and subject to a peace bond get as far as posing a credible (and perhaps actual) suicide bomb threat?</p>
<p>“Why was the police intervention 11th hour, in the nick of time (and perhaps after it, given that there was a reported explosion causing injury)?</p>
<p>“Given the presence of a weapon and that there was apparently a computer video involved, Driver was in clear violation of his peace bond terms (and so basically automatically subject to imprisonment for up to 4 years). So why was there no arrest much earlier?</p>
<p>“Why was there no public warning?</p>
<p>“All of this is to say: Where was the early detection? Was this a resource issue? Did something go missing? Will be discussing a failure to ‘connect the dots’?” (Forcese 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this leads inexorably to the question: “Was the Aaron Driver killing part of yet another entrapment case, like Germinal and like Nuttall and Korody, which somehow went too far or took an unforeseen turn?” Or: “Was it a dangerous game of chicken in which the RCMP miscalculated?” Regardless of one’s view on the matter of this killing by police, it is clear that answers will not be provided by RCMP or CSIS accounts alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Comes of It: Fear Politics and Continuing Repression</p>
<p>To properly understand the real impact and consequences of the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver socially we need only look to current debates over anti-terror laws, particularly the controversial and widely unpopular Anti-Terrorism Act (better known as Bill C-51) initiated by the then-ruling Conservative government prior to the 2016 election, and the recent rebuke of RCMP practices in the Nuttall-Korody decision. This includes a call that emerged immediately in response to the Driver killing to review, and stiffen, terror related peace bonds, the same control mechanisms notably that the government seeks to impose on Nuttall and Korody and for which cause they were re-arrested shortly after their release following the entrapment decision. After the Driver killing the calls are to make the peace bonds even more restrictive and punitive.</p>
<p>The Driver killing comes as critics have been calling for the Liberal government to finally follow through on their election promise, prominent during the campaign, to revise C-51. Now the discussions of possible C-51 revisions will be shadowed by the Driver case and its use by security forces and politicians alike to defend the legislation and perhaps even build upon it.</p>
<p>The cynic will certainly note that on two other occasions in which C-51 and anti-terror laws were set to be debated in federal parliament the discussions were inflamed by highly visible so-called acts of terrorism. Perhaps ironically, the most recent one included the shooting of Canadian Forces soldier Nathan Cirillo by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the online justification of which brought river to the attention of the security apparatus in the first place. It might be noted that, in terms of definitions of terrorism, Zehaf-Bibeau only sought military and government targets and did not target or harm civilians even as he had ample opportunity to do so during his adventure in busy downtown Ottawa.</p>
<p>The reactionary Conservative Party of Canada, authors and shepherds of C-51, have already made this connection of the Driver case to the maintenance of intrusive anti-terror laws explicit. In the words of the Conservative Party’s interim leader Rona Ambrose the morning after Driver was killed:</p>
<p>“I salute and thank the law enforcement and intelligence officers who put their own lives on the line to stop this potential attack on innocent Canadians. Unfortunately, the Liberal government campaigned on a promise to strip these officers of some of the essential investigative and enforcement tools to do this work, which the previous Conservative government provided through Bill C-51, and which have already been wisely used to disrupt terrorist activities nearly two dozen times since last fall. I call on the Liberal government to ensure all of Canada&#8217;s security and intelligence services keep the tools they need to do their jobs.” (quoted in Wherry 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Numerous concerns were raised by a broad cross section of the public in Canada immediately upon the announcement of Bill C-51. Concerns were raised that provisions in the legislation criminalize acts of civil disobedience, such as a protest or demonstration because these could be viewed as “unlawful” (in the absence of a permit, or in cases of trespassing, or marches in roadways). Other essential activities, such as a workplace strike or occupation or boycott could be viewed as terrorist acts on the basis that they impact economic structures or practices. Worries have also been stated about provisions that allow for the punishing of bad thoughts or propaganda rather than actual activities related to terrorist acts.</p>
<p>During the federal election of 2015 the Liberal Party, then seeking to succeed the Conservatives as ruling party, promised legislation that would address key concerns within C-51. Yet approaching a year later after taking power the Liberals have still not tabled even proposals on how they might transform C-51, leaving some critics to believe that the election promises were simply appeals for votes on the basis of countering widely unpopular legislation (which seemed emblematic of the authoritarian and repressive Conservative Party approach). The Liberal government has said in general terms that any new legislation would: “guarantee that all Canadian Security Intelligence Service warrants respect the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; ensure that Canadians are not limited from lawful protests and advocacy; narrow overly broad definitions, such as defining ‘terrorist propaganda’ more clearly;” as well as “limit Communications Security Establishment&#8217;s powers by requiring a warrant to engage in the surveillance of Canadians” (quoted in Wherry 2016).</p>
<p>At the same time there is nothing to suggest, despite the intimations of the Conservative Party and their leader Rona Ambrose, that C-51 provisions played or could have played any part in a case like that of Aaron Driver. The RCMP supposedly acted on the basis of a tip coming not from their own surveillance or intelligence but rather from the FBI. In addition Driver was already subject to a terror peace bond which have been in operation since before C-51 took effect. Notably Driver’s legal team mounted a successful challenge which resulted in a Manitoba judge ruling against the provision in C-51 that allowed the courts to mandate religious counselling for an individual on a peace bond (Wherry 2016).</p>
<p>Another line of pursuit for repressive forces in the Canadian context involves calling into question the anti-terror peace bond, not on grounds that it threatens civil liberties and is too broad, but on obverse grounds that it is too lenient. On one hand there are calls for imprisonment of people simply on the basis of the low threshold evidence used in securing the peace bond. This would mean criminalizing bad thoughts, which, in fact, many police and politicians desire anyway. As law professor Craig Forcese suggests: “Incarceration depends, however, on a crime. And our terrorism criminal law already sets the tripwire for terrorism crime very far from actual acts of violence. (None of the two dozen or so persons in prison for post-9/11 terrorism crimes got further than plotting before they were charged and convicted)” (2016). Calls for incarceration on the low level of evidence provided for a peace bond will put many people in prison who pose no material threat to anyone (except perhaps to themselves). It will, however, give an opportunity for expansion of the security, surveillance, and policing apparatus as well as the prison-industrial complex, which is precisely what many police agencies and politicians alike desire.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some hawks will call for greater integration of security and intelligence services. This will include not only calls for tighter integration or greater communication and information transfer between agencies within the Canadian state (among local police forces, the RCMP, CSIS, perhaps the military). It will also include calls for greater integration and/or communication between the Canadian agencies and external agencies like the FBI or MI5. This will be highlighted especially given the apparently lead and crucial role played by the FBI in the Driver affair. Indeed even liberal critics like Forcese have been quick to proclaim that coordination between police and CSIS, as in the Driver case “is welcome” (proclaiming even before all the facts are known that “the system worked” in this case) (see Forcese 2016).</p>
<p>Menacingly the Liberal government has suggested a focus on counter-radicalization strategies. While they have provided not even general notions of what this might entail there are examples from other liberal democracies that open ominous possibilities, including the case in the UK in which legislation requires post-secondary faculty to report to police instances in which students appear to be radicalizing. Notably some have used the Driver example to argue that the so-called religious therapy provision in anti-terror peace bonds, deemed “deprogramming” by the court and struck down, should have been upheld and should now be imposed in future cases.</p>
<p>Following the Aaron Driver killing the Liberal government is clearly open to additions to the apparatus as part of the C-51 discussions. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, addressing questions after the Driver killing said the government will now “consult Canadians about what else they want to see in their national security framework” (quoted in Wherry 2016). What else indeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In all of this the RCMP killing of Aaron Driver provides another example of the political production of fear for purposes of state, particularly police, expansion. It provides another opportunity for the dramatization of evil by state authorities at various levels. This can in turn be used to shore up or develop new mechanisms of surveillance, criminalization, and punishment. It can be used to reinforce legislation, like C-51, that faces criticism and possible revision. It can provide the impetus for new, more repressive, legislation. It can be used to increase the flow of resources to agencies like the RCMP. In addition such moments of manipulable terror panic can be used to spread policing practices into other sectors. Such is the case in legislation, as in the UK that seeks to turn professors into spies, snitches, or cops.</p>
<p>All of this must be resisted. Police must always be challenged and countered on their exclusive descriptions of events (and monopoly on knowledge about the circumstances of such cases). Police accounts should never be accepted at face value. There must also be public mobilizations against any and all attempts to expand the security state apparatus. Furthermore, public manipulation of terror panics must be called out and attempts by state and media actors to manufacture social phobias confronted.</p>

",Deadly Force (2018),
0122-V1,"Police received a call from a woman at a hospital reporting Nicolas Allan (Nik) Jeppesen as distressed and armed with an axe, according to an announcement from a continuing investigation. Police confronted him near the hospital's helicopter landing pad and used a stun gun to subdue him. He suffered injuries during the arrest and died later in hospital. The independent investigation continues.; Police received a call from a woman at a hospital reporting Nicolas Allan (Nik) Jeppesen as distressed and armed with an axe, according to a report from the IIO. Two officers confronted him near the hospital's helicopter landing pad and used their tasers to subdue him as he held the axe to his neck. During the altercation, Jeppesen's neck was cut by his axe. He died in hospital. Following their investigation the IIO absolved the officers of any wrongdoing.
<p>For a small town detachment the Terrace, BC, RCMP have gained some infamy for violence against civilians, including civilian deaths. On August 21, 2016 Nicolas Allan Jeppesen (29) died after being tased by officers of the Terrace RCMP outside the town’s Mills Memorial Hospital. The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the body that reviews police violence involving civilians, is investigating the RCMP involvement in Jeppesen’s death but few details have been provided to the public. The BC Coroner’s Service, which has a broader mandate for investigation, is also investigating.</p>
<p>What has been reported is that in the early afternoon of August 21, RCMP officers were called to the hospital following a report of a man carrying an axe and a possibility that he might do harm to himself. There has been no report that he posed a threat to anyone else. The man was reportedly seen near the area of the hospital’s mental health ward. Upon encountering Jeppesen RCMP used a Taser, a conducted energy weapon, to subdue the man. During the intervention by police the victim received undisclosed injuries, through undisclosed means, from which he died after being taken inside the hospital.</p>
<p>Josh Paterson of the BC Civil Liberties Association notes the concerns around fatalities associated with the use of Tasers by police. In his words:</p>
<p>“In general we’ve had lots of concerns about the use of conducted energy weapons, the reliability of conductive energy weapons, the safety of them. We understand that it’s a good thing for police to be turning to less lethal force options … but we’ve seen numerous incidents around North America that Tasers don’t end up always being non-lethal force.” (quoted in Nichols 2016)</p>
<p>There have so far been no independent reports offering information beyond what the RCMP have claimed. Yet there are almost certainly witnesses to the interaction. It is also possible that witnesses will not come forward given the reputation of Terrace RCMP and community fears that exist regarding the force.</p>

Police alleged that when they arrived, Murphy charged at them with a knife. News reports say he was shot at least twice, and died from his wounds. The incident is currently under investigation.; According to news reports, police were given Chad Murphy's address by a family member after his behaviour became worrisome. Police alleged that when they arrived, Murphy charged at them with a knife. A preliminary report by Quebec's police watchdog, the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes, or BEI, says an officer fired three shots. The Crown prosecutor's office did not charge the officers involved. 
<p>Police in Canada kill a disproportionate number of people in mental distress. They continue to be deployed to engage with people experiencing mental distress despite the fact that history shows that police respond to those situations with a very quick use of lethal force.</p>
<p>In the case of the killing of Chad Murphy (45), it is estimated that from the moment Sûreté du Québec (SQ) officers opened the door to Murphy’s basement apartment in Île-Perrot, it took only 30 seconds for police to fatally shoot him.</p>
<p>On Monday, February 12, 2018, Quebec’s director of criminal and penal prosecutions (DPCP) announced it will not be filing charges against any of the officers involved in shooting and killing Chad Murphy on October 2, 2016. The SQ had been notified by Murphy’s sister Sharon that he was distressed and suicidal after fleeing in anger from a family dispute. She said at the time that she made the call to get him help not to get him killed.</p>
<p>Officers allegedly tried to talk with Murphy through his apartment door before opening it with a key provided by a neighbor. The DPCP report says officers saw Murphy sitting on his living room floor with a knife in hand and when he saw the officers he started cutting himself. When he stood up and walked toward the door the police shot and killed him. Thirty seconds to interact with and kill a man.</p>
<p>The DPCP ruled that in shooting a man in distress who was harming himself, after only 30 seconds of interaction, the officers involved did not use excessive force and should not face criminal charges. The DPCP statement said: “A legally acceptable use of force is one that is not gratuitous and is applied in a measured way. The intervention was legal and is based primarily on the duty of the police officers to ensure the safety and security of others.” The report does not say that Murphy was using his knife in a way that threatened anyone other than himself. It does not say how many shots police fired.</p>
<p>This is pure propaganda, copaganda. Shooting someone in distress and harming only himself is described as measured. And it does not show how the safety and security of others, the public for example, was threatened. This decision is the state protecting the state.</p>
<p>The DPCP’s decision to not lay charges in the killing of Chad Murphy is based on the investigation by the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), the body that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province. The BEI is not independent and relies on police forces for their forensic investigation.</p>
<p>Since June of 2016, the BEI has investigated 72 cases. This includes 37 fatal police interventions and four deaths that occurred during police detention. Of all of the investigations completed and turned over to prosecutors so far, <em>none</em> have led to charges against a single officer. The state does indeed protect the state.</p>

0137-V1,"Confirmed details about the death of Samuel Maloney by a continuing independent investigation include the fact that police went to a residence where there they had a confrontation with Maloney, who was shot and died at the scene. One or more officers were injured during the incident. The investigation is working on a timeline for the event and looking into whether police used appropriate force.; An SIU investigation into the death of Samuel Maloney found that police visited his residence as a result of his activity online. Maloney shot one officer with a crossbow, according to the SIU report. The officer returned fire, striking Maloney once in the shoulder. Maloney then fled into another room where two officers were speaking with his wife and children. Those officers shot Maloney with a submachine gun and a rifle, striking him four times, including a shot to the head. Maloney died at the scene. The SIU investigation resulted in no criminal charges for the police officers involved.
<p>Police in London, Ontario killed Samuel Maloney, 35, early Friday morning around 6 AM, December 23, 2016, at his home on the city’s Duchess Avenue. Police fired into the house and killed the victim while at least one child, including a toddler, was present inside. A woman, said to be living at the home, was reported immediately after the killing by police to be holding the toddler. Two children, the two-year-old boy and a six-month-old baby girl live in the house. Their father is now dead.</p>
<p>The differential and deferential treatment given killer police by mass media compared to what is shown to the victims of police is exemplified in the headline used by the <em>National Post</em> newspaper in the case of this killing. The headline, “London Cop Shot with a Crossbow During Confrontation that Led to Man Being Gunned Down by Police,” focuses on harm supposedly incurred by an officer (an injury) rather than the killing of the civilian (who may have had nothing to do with the crossbow). In fact the national paper does not even give the victim the dignity of saying he was killed by police. Instead he was “gunned down” as if some undeserving villain in an old West drama. The stricken officer is even given first notice, and primary concern, in the first sentence in the article. Yet the officer’s injuries are reported as only minor.</p>
<p>The news accounts also focus on a previous weapons raid at the home in 2007, when Maloney was 26. This sets the stage to pose the victim as a legitimate target. Despite the fact that, as the report later reveals, Samuel Maloney was found to have all of his weapons properly registered. This image of a weapons hoarder in a Canadian context is explicitly meant to evoke the vision of some gun obsessed survivalist a la the US context of NRA extremists. Yet it is curious that someone with a supposedly massive weapons cache would use a crossbow rather than a gun if they sought to do real damage to police. Interestingly though it is the victim’s partner Melissa Facciolo, 35, who is charged with possession of a prohibited weapon—the crossbow.</p>
<p>As in virtually every case in which police kill a civilian in Canada, the media turn focus directly to the history of the victim to legitimize whatever actions police might have taken. This case is no different in that regard. Yet there is nothing to suggest that the victim’s weapons ownership is in any way related to violent or threatening or even seriously criminal behavior. And in any event, as in all such cases, random or trivial accounts of some aspect of personal history say nothing about a victim’s activities in the moment in which police killed them.</p>
<p>It has still not been independently confirmed that Maloney was the person who supposedly fired a cross bow striking an officer. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which investigates cases of harm to civilians by police officers in Ontario, has designated three subject officers as well as 18 witness officers in the case. Apparently no charge have been disclosed related to any reason police attended the house in the first place. In addition police refuse to say why they were at the home.</p>

The 58-year-old man shot multiple times and killed by Montreal police has been identified as Pierre Coriolan, a Black male of Haitian background who was know to suffer mental health issues. It has now been further revealed that Coriolan was facing eviction from the apartment he had been living in since 2008 on July 1, 2017, and that this had understandably greatly distressed him. The eviction order was issued against Mr. Coriolan by the Quebec rental board on June 1 according to Claudine Laurin, director general of la Fédération des OSBL d’habitation de Montréal, an organization of subsidized housing apartments.

<p>A judge in London, Ontario, has found Constable Nicholas Doering guilty in the death of 39-year-old Debra Chrisjohn, an Indigenous woman, the mother of 11 children, who died shortly after being arrested. Chrisjohn, of Oneida of the Thames First Nation, was arrested on September 7, 2016, after police were to Trafalgar Street and Highbury Avenue North, an intersection in London’s east end, regarding a woman allegedly obstructing traffic.</p>
<p>Chrisjohn was arrested by London police and then transferred to the Elgin County OPP detachment. Paramedics later took her to St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital at 7:52 PM. She was pronounced dead almost one hour later.</p>

<p>The conviction of a police officer in the death of a civilian remains rare in Canada. Yet it is worth noting that this conviction comes only a day after killer cop Justin Holz was sentenced to 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to dangerous driving causing death for killing Cody Severight, a 23-year-old Indigenous man in 2017.</p>

<p>No explanation has been given for why charges of criminal negligence causing death have been dropped against Constable Mark McKillop of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) in the death of Debra Chrisjohn (39) of Oneida Nation of the Thames.</p>
<p>In a public statement Chrisjohn’s family said this about the dropping of charges: “The decision by the Crown… is hard for the family to understand. We hope that everyone who played a role will be held accountable.”</p>
<p>Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province,  had charged two police officers with the death of Chrisjohn—Constable Nicholas Doering of the London Police Service (LPS) and OPP Constable McKillop. McKillop and Doering faced one charge each of criminal negligence causing death and failing to provide the necessities of life. Doering will still face those charges.</p>
<p>London Police Service officers responded to calls made to 911 during the late afternoon of September 7, 2016. Chrisjohn was arrested by LPS and transferred into the custody of Ontario Provincial Police with the Elgin County detachment.  At around 7:52 PM, Emergency Medical Services transported Chrisjohn to St. Thomas Hospital where she was pronounced dead at 8:43 PM.</p>
<p>Caitlyn Kasper, a lawyer at Aboriginal Legal Services and counsel for the family, noted that the family has still not been provided with basic details of the death of their loved one. Kasper explained in the public statement:</p>
<p>“Without knowing the specific details surrounding the death of Debra, it is difficult for the family to assess the decision by the office of the Crown attorney. However, we know that as this active prosecution moves towards preliminary inquiry or trial, more details will emerge. In the meantime, I certainly expect that the Ontario Provincial Police will be thoroughly reviewing the actions of Const. McKillop to determine if there were breaches of the Police Services Act.”</p>

<p>Nearly a year after the death of Debra Chrisjohn in police custody, and even after the filing of charges against police officers responsible, Constable Mark McKillop of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and Constable Nicholas Doering of the London Police Service, many issues remain unaddressed and unanswered about police actions in her arrest, detention, and death. Beyond the specific actions undertaken by police, the circumstances of Chrisjohn’s death raise issues of police racism and violence against Indigenous people and communities.</p>
<p>Debra Chrisjohn (39) of the Oneida Nation of the Thames was arrested on September 7, 2016. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, announced on July 13, 2017, that constables McKillop and Doeriing have been charged with one count each of criminal negligence causing death and failing to provide the necessaries of life. Both had contact with Chrsijohn on the day she died. The family has received few facts about the death of their loved one beyond this.</p>
<p>The family wants to know why the officers did not seek medical attention for their loved one when it became apparent that she needed help. Debra Chrisjohn’s father Robert Chrisjohn, asks: “Why didn’t the police take her to the hospital sooner when they knew she was sick and needed help? The police arrested her and were responsible for making sure she was okay. This happens way too often in our community. This happens all the time. The police just don’t seem to care” (quoted in McQuigge 2017)</p>
<p>Caitlyn Kasper, of Toronto’s Aboriginal Legal Services, claims that police had enough information available to deal with Debra Chrisjohn’s case in a different way. For example, police knew that Chrisjohn had a documented history of both substance abuse and mental illness. At the time of her arrest and detention on September 7, 2017, there were clear indications that Chrisjohn was in need of medical attention, not time in police custody</p>
<p>The family and community advocates insist that any discussion related to the actions of these officers in this case must address the troubling behaviors of police forces across Canada in dealing with Indigenous communities. This is, of course, an ongoing history of colonial violence and brutality. In the words of Caitlyn Kasper: “What happened to Debra is not an isolated incident. It is very obvious that it isn’t these types of issues just in London or the Oneida First Nation. It’s a concern we hear about in Toronto, all across Ontario and all across Canada” (quoted in McQuigge 2017)</p>
<p>.According to Kasper, the case against the officers must focus on what she terms the “foundational relationship” between police and Indigenous people across the Canadian state (McQuigge 2017). Kasper notes the ongoing questions of police responsibility in cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women, Many believe that police have been purposefully negligent in investigating those cases. Others suggest that police are themselves involved in the killings and disappearances of Indigenous women. Samantha Doxtator, a friend of the victim, has stitched together traditional moccasin vamps to commemorate Debra Chrisjohn and is sending them to be included in an art installation in memory of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>Giselle Dias, an area psychotherapist who has spent 25 years working for prisoners’ rights, insists it be acknowledged that Indigenous and marginalized communities are most impacted by the criminal justice system in Canada. She agrees that Chrisjohn&#8217;s death points fundamentally to the a systemic issue of over-policing and mistreatment within racialized communities (Ghonaim 2017). And she is rightly not optimistic about the court process offering any redress. In her words: “Just because these police officers have been charged, it doesn’t mean that they’re going to be found guilty. I will not rest assured” (quoted in Ghonaim 2017).</p>
<p>In case after case this truth remains. The system protects itself and that includes protecting killer cops.</p>

<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the body that examines cases of police harm to civilians has announced that two police officers have been charged in the 2016 death of Debra Chrisjohn, of Oneida Nation of the Thames. The officers charged are Ontario Provincial Police Constable Mark McKillop and London Police Service Constable Nicholas Doering. The killer cops face charges of criminal negligence causing death and failing to provide the necessities of life, respectively. Chrisjohn, died while in police custody, only an hour after she was taken to hospital.</p>
<p>Details surrounding the death have not been made available and many questions remain to be answered. What has been said, though there has been no independent confirmation, is that London police were called to Trafalgar Street and Highbury Avenue North, a neighborhood in that city’s east end on September 7, 2016 for someone supposedly obstructing traffic. Chrisjohn was arrested by London police for the obstruction and then transferred to the Elgin County OPP detachment supposedly on an outstanding warrant from 2013.</p>
<p>The rest remains obscure, with the SIU refusing even to name a cause of death publicly. So far they have only been willing to offer that at some point on the afternoon of September 7, 2016, Chrisjohn was moved to a jail operated by the OPP. Chrisjohn was taken by paramedics from the jail to St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital at 7:52 PM. She was pronounced dead there at 8:43 PM.</p>
<p>Even family members have not been given toxicology results or been told details of their loved one’s death in custody. This is a stark situation given repeated calls for transparency in the SIU and its reporting system.</p>
<p>Constable Doering could face up to five years in jail, while Constable McKillop faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. It virtually never happens that a killer cop is convicted for their actions let alone receiving a maximum sentence. Both officers are still on duty. McKillop is on active duty with the OPP, while Doering is doing administrative duties</p>
<p>Members of the Oneida Nation of the Thames hope that these charges will bring some attention to the mistreatment of Indigenous women by police. Complaints have long been raised against various police services for inflicting extreme violence, including sexual violence, against Indigenous women.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, April 24, 2018, two inquests were called into separate police killings of civilians in Manitoba which happened within a week and a half of each other in September 2017. The chief medical examiner in Manitoba has called an inquest into the police shooting and killing of 23-year-old Adrian Lacquette of Winnipeg on September 13. Manitoba Justice announced a separate inquest into the shootings and killings of 33-year-old Evan Grant Caron, who was fatally shot by police 10 days after the shooting of Adrian Lacquette.</p>
<p>Both victims were Indigenous men. This fact is reflective of the colonial and racist violence of policing in Manitoba (and Canada more broadly). At least 11 of the known 19 people killed by police in Manitoba between 2000 and 2017 were identified as Indigenous.</p>
<p>The inquests cannot assign blame or lead to arrests and police are under no obligation to follow any recommendations that might result from either inquest.</p>

<p>A Winnipeg mother is grieving and seeking answers after Winnipeg police shot and 23-year-old son, Adrian Lacquette in the early morning hours of September 13, 2017. Jo-Anne Malcolm says she found out about her son’s killing when representatives of the Independent Investigations Unit (IIU) came to her home around 6:00 AM. Malcolm recounts that interaction: “They said, ‘Do you know Adrian?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, that’s my son.’ I knew right away, I didn’t even ask. I said, ‘Is he dead?’ and they said, ‘Yeah. Sorry to tell you, ma’am. He was shot this morning” (quoted in Malone 2017). This is the ninth police shooting of a civilian in Manitoba since June 2015.</p>
<p>Police have claimed that a man, whom they would not name, was shot on Alfred Avenue near Powers Street in the city’s North End just before 1:00 AM Wednesday. Malcolm reports being told that the incident involved suspicion of a stolen car.</p>
<p>Clayton Campbell, who lives on Alfred Avenue near Powers Street, said that the incident happened very quickly. Police seemed to open fire shortly after encountering the victim. In his words: “It happened in a moment, a split moment. It was an eruption of gunfire” (quoted in Malone 2017).</p>
<p>Jo-Anne Malcolm wants to know what happened. In her words: “I want everybody to know that they shot my son for nothing, for a stolen car. I don&#8217;t think they should have shot him. My son is well-known to police, but they don&#8217;t have to treat him like that” (quoted in Malone 2017).</p>

Police said he was making threatening gestures with the knife when they shot and killed him. Cloutier had been an on-and-off client with Maison Claude-Laramée for homeless people with mental illness. Homeless advocate Matthew Pearce questioned whether lethal force was necessary, citing the recent history of four fatal police shootings of homeless men.; Jimmy Cloutier stabbed a man before police confronted him on the street, according to news reports. Police said he was making threatening gestures with the knife when they shot and killed him. Cloutier had been an on-and-off client with Maison Claude-Laramée for homeless people with mental illness. Homeless advocate Matthew Pearce questioned whether lethal force was necessary. Cloutier was shot multiple times.  The Crown prosecutor's office did not charge the officers. In its report, it said that the investigation led by the police watchdog agency Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes, or BEI, determined the police officers involved did not commit any criminal offence.
<p>The 38-year-old man shot and killed by Montreal Police on Friday, January 6, 2017, has been identified as Jimmy Cloutier, a homeless man who made use of shelter services at the Old Brewery Mission. The Old Brewery Mission  reported that Cloutier was a long-time client who had attended the shelter especially for meals and changes of clothing. Shelter director Matthew Pearce said that Cloutier had participated in a program at Maison Claude-Laramée for homeless people with mental health issues, a program run jointly by the shelter and the Douglas Mental Health University Institute (CBC 2017). Cloutier had no attended the shelter for four years after completing the program. Pearce reported that over the past year, Cloutier had been a “fairly frequent visitor” and seemed fine the day of the shooting, stopping by the cafeteria to get coffee (CBC 2017).</p>
<p>Surveillance camera video from the police killing of Cloutier shows the victim tossing a cup of liquid, presumed to be coffee from the shelter, on the ground before bending over, apparently to set something else down, before then picking up a bag and walking out of the view of the camera (CTV Montreal 2017). Cloutier is pursued by several police officers clearly holding firearms. The man was shot and killed only seconds later. Police claim that he was armed and made some “aggressive gesture” at them, but this has not been independently confirmed.</p>
<p>Indeed homeless people on the scene were upset that the police had used lethal force against Cloutier and deployed it so quickly. They have asked why no alternatives were attempted first. Police became aggrieve with homeless people on the scene who merely raised questions about the actions taken by police. Those wondering why police chose not to use less-lethal options have continued to raise concerns. According to Milosz Janda, the Old Brewery Mission social counsellor: “They just want to find out what was the reason for such behaviour? Why was it done that way? Why weren’t other possible approaches there?” (quoted in CTV Montreal 2017).</p>
<p>Cloutier is the fourth homeless person known to have been killed by Montreal police officers in the past few years. This fact is not lost on Old Brewery Mission director Matthew Pearce. He points out the awful history of police engagement with poor and homeless people. According to Pearce: “Four incidents of confrontation with the police, and four deaths. Not injuries – deaths. I have to feel that in each of those there were other options that could have been pursued” (quoted in CTV Montreal 2017). He suggests that police are too fearful and stressed out by homeless and street involved people.</p>
<p>The circumstances of the police killing of Jimmy Cloutier are all too familiar for family members of other homeless people killed by Montreal Police. Pierre Magloire’s brother Alain was shot and killed by police two years ago. Magloire’s response to this latest killing was dismay. In his words: “I was, like, ‘Again? Oh my God.’ How come we are at the same place we were two, three years ago?” (quoted in CTV Montreal 2017). He echoes the belief that police are too panicked in dealing with people who may be experiencing distress: “They are not ready to deal with someone. They are getting afraid very fast” (quoted in CTV Montreal 2017).</p>
<p>These killings are extreme forms of the poorbashing that police regularly inflict on homeless people. It extends from habitual police practices of harassment, intimidation, bullying, and violence. It reflects police perspectives that view homeless people as “problems” or unworthy victims, or detritus.</p>

Police intervention ""became physical."" The officers struggled with Celik and during the course of restraining him, he went into cardiac arrest. An ambulance arrived, but Celik could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead in hospital. The case is being investigated by an independent investigative body. The autopsy found that he died of a cardio-pulmonary arrest due to intoxication along with the context of agitated delirium. A pre-existing condition may also have played a role. The independent investigation stated that police also didn't follow protocol as they interviewed witnesses before the BEI arrived.

<p>Koray Kevin Celik (28) died during a police intervention at his family’s Île-Bizard home one year ago. On March 6, 2018, his family organized a vigil outside the Pierrefonds police station to commemorate their loved one and raise some troubling questions about police actions, and accounts of their actions, in Koray Celik’s death. Celik’s parents, Cesur and June, say their son needs to be remembered and what happened to him needs to be discussed publicly. And this discussion needs to happen loudly and often until there is some change (Feith 2018).</p>
<p>Koray Kevin Celik, 28, died during a police intervention at the family’s Île-Bizard home one year ago when the young man was experiencing some distress. Said Cesur Celik: “My son was in crisis and was in a vulnerable state. When the police walked in, he was standing. When they left, they carried his body out. He lost his life in their hands, in front of our eyes.” (quoted in Feith 2018).</p>
<p>Celik acknowledged that the parents called the police seeking help and assistance. The call was made a bit before 2 AM. The parents did not want him their son to hurt himself or to leave the house (Feith 2018). They now express regret at having called police at all.</p>
<p>What happened during the police intervention is under investigation. Few details have been made public. According to Quebec’s Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), the body that examines police interventions connected to deaths or injuries in the province, Montreal police responded to a call regarding a distressed man. The official story says that upon arriving at the house in Île-Bizard, Koray Celik became aggressive and suffered a fatal heart attack while police tried to control him (Feith 2018).</p>
<p>Cesur Celik, who says he witnessed the interaction in his home, rejects the bureau’s public version of events. He says four officers “brutally and viciously beat” his son before he died (2018). The family is considering legal action against the Montreal police force. They have tried to see a police incident report, autopsy, or coroner’s report but their efforts have been thwarted at each turn. The lack of information has added to the family’s grief. Says Cesur Celik: “We’ve been living with this nightmare ever since. One year later and there is still nothing. How can that be?” (quoted Feith 2018).</p>
<p>The Montreal police force (SPVM) has refused to comment on what happened the night Koray Celik died. Since June 2016, the BEI has investigated 72 cases. These include 37 fatal police interventions and five deaths that occurred during police detention (Feith 2018).</p>
<p>At the March 6 vigil, family and friends held signs reading : “Justice for Koray”; “We will not go away”; “The law applies to everyone” (Feith 2018).</p>

According to evidence presented to Quebec’s independent investigation bureau, officers found Racine agitated and banging her head. They placed her in handcuffs before realizing her condition appeared to be “deteriorating.” She was taken to hospital, where she died. The cause of death remains under investigation.
<p>It is a situation that is happening far too frequently in the Canadian policing context. Experiencing mental distress is levied a death sentence when police are sent to intervene. On Wednesday, January 25, 2017, Nadia Racine (34) died from injuries sustained during a violent arrest by Gatineau police the day before. Racine was injured and had been taken to hospital after police arrested her in her apartment at 24 Rue Charles-Albanel.</p>
<p>Sadly police were responding to a simple noise complaint called in by a neighbor who heard banging and screaming coming from the victim’s apartment. Shawn Lescard, who lives in the apartment directly above hers recounted: “It sounded like she was getting beaten. I wanted to save her life. I thought she was getting beaten and that&#8217;s why I called the cops. Now&#8230;she’s passed away” (quoted in CBC News 2017). Calling the cops too often ends fatally when mental health issues are involved and should not be an option when someone is experiencing mental distress. Lescard called the Gatineau police non-emergency phone line. He was shaken by news of his neighbor’s death:  “She seemed like a good person. Quiet. She [kept] to herself. It&#8217;s pretty sad the way she went” (quoted in CBC News 2017).</p>
<p>According to the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI, Bureau of Independent Investigations), the provincial body that examines police harm to civilians in Quebec, Gatineau police said officers responded to the noise complaint at around 6:14 PM Tuesday. BEI spokesman Martin Bonin-Charron reports that when police arrived at Racine&#8217;s apartment they received no answer at the door and then forced their way in. Inside the apartment they claim to have found Racine in a state of “mental distress.” According to Bonin-Charron: “She was banging her head around the apartment” (quoted in CBC News 2017). The BEI has not said anything about the arrest that led to Racine’s injuries that did report police put her in handcuffs. According to the BEI: “The police officers, they handcuffed her before realizing she was in [medical] distress” (quoted in CBC News 2017). It is not clear why police handcuffed someone who at most was suggested as a victim of assault based on the call put in by the neighbor Lescard. One might well note the contradiction in the police reports already though. On one hand they say they entered the apartment to find the victim in distress but on the other hand they claim to have handcuffed her before realizing she was in distress.</p>
<p>The BEI has assigned eight investigators to this case. They are not an independent oversight body and as a result will be joined in the investigation (and monitored) by the Sûreté du Québec, the provincial police.</p>

Police attempted to use a stun gun, but it was ineffective. When he raised the knife police opened fire. An inquest found the shooting justified, and that there was no evidence of systemic racism in the moments leading to the Indigenous man's death.
<p>Racism and policing have gone hand and hand in the Canadian context. From the settler colonial violence of the RCMP through contemporary practices from carding to assaults upon racialized people and communities. The settler colonial character of the Canadian state continues in the current context in the disproportionate arrest and incarceration of Indigenous people and the exertion of violence, often lethal violence, against them.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly the Canadian state and the various institutions of criminal justice have stridently denied claims of racism. Inquiries into police violence typically offer findings that diminish or deny the part of racism in police actions. Such an outcome was delivered again on May 12, 2017 with the results of the inquiry into the killing of Craig McDougall, a young Indigenous man, by Winnipeg police, a force with a long and notorious history of racist violence.</p>
<p>Twenty-six-year-old Craig Vincent McDougall was shot and killed by police outside his father’s home on Simcoe Street in Winnipeg on August 2, 2008. Police claimed to be responding to a 911 call when they arrived at the home in the early hours of August 2.  They suggest that found McDougall outside the house holding a cell phone and a knife. One officer shot him with a taser. He was then shot with a firearm which killed him. A private investigator who examined the case has cast doubt on the assertion that Craig McDougall held a knife at the moment he was shot.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the victim’s family members were immediately arrested and put in handcuffs on the front lawn, an act of what criminologists term the dramatization of evil, designed to denigrate and humiliate people targeted by the system. Jonathan Rudin, an expert witness on Indigenous people, policing, and the criminal justice system, testified that the treatment of McDougall’s family after the young man was shot exemplified systemic racism as the victims were assumed by police to be criminals and were treated as such.</p>
<p>Still, despite the actions of police, the inquest concluded that there was no evidence of racism in the police actions. It offered the typical statist finding that police were justified in their actions. In the inquest report, Associate Chief Judge Anne Krahn wrote there was “no evidence of racism direct or systemic in the moments leading to the shooting of Craig McDougall.” The judge found the arrest of McDougall’s father and uncle to be a simple misstep. In her words: &#8220;there were missteps in the immediate aftermath of the shooting when Craig McDougall’s uncle and father were left handcuffed and detained without lawful authority.&#8221; Such is the normalization of racism in the Canadian criminal justice system. Atrocious actions become mere missteps.</p>
<p>Critics point out that treating the family members in such disrespectful and accusatory fashion exemplifies racism. One might add the little regard shown for the family or the community in the eight year delay between the killing and the inquest report. It could be suggested that such an egregious delay would never be accepted in the case of a killing (by anyone) of a white, privileged victim. Of course police, and police associations, seek to delay and divert inquests to benefit their own interests.</p>
<p>The inquest report even contradicts its own conclusions by making recommendations that imply racism by police. Among these recommendations are that the police service should consider delivery of implicit bias training for its members at regular intervals (a recognition of racist assumptions) and work with Indigenous organizations to develop programs.</p>

Several people were said to be in the residence at which Stephens was killed when the shooting happened.</p>
<p>The dangerous nature of this police action and the prospect it will stoke justified anger toward RCMP are clear. Police seem concerned with dampening any response. Chief Superintendent Tony Hamori, the officer in charge of Southern Alberta made an appeal with no note of accountability or reasons for adherence: “I also urge calm in the community while the investigations take place” (quoted by Anderson 2017).</p>
<p>Community members describe a chaotic scene after police arrived on the scene. According to Gerald Powderface, a relative of Ralph Stephens: “My family told me it happened so quick, even my cousin was asking them ‘Have you shot my boy?’ They didn’t even answer him, they just dragged him out of the house without no shoes and they&#8217;re throwing people out of the house left and right. They didn’t even answer his question, ‘Have you shot my boy? What happened, what’s going on here?’” (quoted in Anderson 2017).</p>
<p>The community has come to the family’s care and support. According to Gerald Powderface: We have a community here that support each other on every matter, especially a matter like that. They all come to the house. There was a lot of people there last night when I left” (quoted in Anderson 2017).</p>
<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating the RCMP actions in killing Ralph Stephens. RCMP continue to maintain an active presence on the reserve since the shooting.</p>
<p>Whatever one might think about this particular case the fact remains that an historic settler colonial force built on dispossession, expropriation, and genocide continues to police Indigenous communities across Canada.</p>

Police were aware that Taqqaugaq had schizophrenia and was susceptible to delusions. When police arrived Taqqaugaq came outside to talk with them, but the incident escalated when he refused to be handcuffed and one of the officers fired a stun gun that failed. Taqqaugaq retreated into the home and returned with a knife, chasing the officers. One of the officers shot him mulitple times, and Taqqaugaq died at hospital. No charges were laid in the incident.
<p>It is rare in the Canadian context that police officers who kill civilians are ever named publicly. This generally only happens in the few cases that result in charges laid against police or in case of a public inquiry or inquest. With the coroner’s inquest onto the police killing of Felix Taqqaugaq on March 20, 2012, mandatory in cases of police harm to civilians in Nunavut, the RCMP officers who killed him have been identified publicly as Constable Jason Trites and Sergeant Peter Marshall.</p>
<p>Constable Trites knew that Taqqaugaq was dealing with mental health issues, which the officer understood to be schizophrenia, yet he still moved quickly to arrest the man for supposedly uttering threats and fired a taser at him only moments into the encounter (and before the man had done anything more than speak to officers). The taser fire may have upset Taqqaugaq who was then chased back into his house by Sergeant Marshall. In response to this police chase Taqqaugaq may have returned brandishing a knife.</p>
<p>By Trite’s own admission he tripped (apparently in a panic) while backing away from Taqqaugaq and firing his handgun. This left Trites with a self-inflicted wound to his hand. This injury was initially reported publicly but it was not clarified that Trites had shot himself. Such early reports of officer injuries, without the information that the injuries are self-inflicted, can give the impression that police were physically threatened or harmed and thus justified in using lethal force. A similarly deceptive mention of injury to an officer (that later was identified as officer-inflicted) was given in the RCMP killing of Hudson Brooks in Surrey, British Columbia. While on his back Trites shot Taqqaugaq three times. The man was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>According to Mary Ijjangiaq, Taqqaugaq’s partner of 13 years the police instigated the situation that led to the killing. In her words to the inquest: “They ganged up on him. He was deliberately provoked. I think [the officer] deliberately made sure he died” (quoted in Murray 2016a). She says the victim held a knife at his chest not over his head in a threatening manner as police claim.</p>
<p>Police audio from the incident raise further questions and ppint to a very quick escalation to lethal force by police. From the moment that officers radioed in to the Iqaluit command centre reporting they had located the suspect only 60 seconds passed before one officer called out “Shots fired; suspect down” (Murray 2016a).</p>
<p>As cops typically do in such cases officer Trites has attempted to present himself as the victim requiring sympathy. In his pitch to the inquiry he attempts to make the family feel sorry for himself: “I just hope the family knows that they’re not the only ones that were hurt by this. The things that I deal with, do affect my personal life. I’m definitely not the same person as I used to be before this incident” (quoted in Murray 2016b).</p>
<p>Incredibly both Constable Trites and Sergeant Marshall were flown out of the northern community (where the RCMP is a still colonial force) the very next day after the killing of Felix Taqqaugaq. Trites has testified at the inquest by video from Halifax.</p>

<p>Police should not be called to address people dealing with mental health issues. Yet too often they are. In the Canadian context this results disproportionately in killings of civilians experiencing mental health distress by police. This is true in communities large and small, rural and urban. It occurs in southern cities and northern communities like Igloolik, Nunavut.</p>
<p>More than four years ago RCMP in Igloolik shot and killed Felix Taqqaugaq (29) in his own home only moments after encountering the man. The March 20, 2012 killing occurred after Taqqaugaq called into a local radio station and engaged in something of a wordy rant. For some reason a listener decided to call the RCMP about the man. RCMP encountered the victim at his home and killed him.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, November 1, 2016 a coroner’s inquest into the killing of Taqqaugaq by police began. Nunavut Chief Coroner Padma Suramala will carry out the inquest, which will run until November 11. Findings from an earlier investigation by the Ottawa Police Service will be addressed.</p>
<p>Family members have noted that Felix Taqqaugaq experienced mental health issues. It remains unclear why anyone would call police upon hearing someone ranting on a radio progam.</p>

Culver was put in a cruiser, but he was having trouble breathing. When EMTs arrived, Culver collapsed and was pronounced dead at hospital. A coroner found swelling in his brain. The B.C. Civil Liberties Association has filed a complaint alleging racial profiling played a role in the encounter, and that police told a witness to delete cellphone footage of the incident. The IIO has completed its investigation last year and referred its findings to the Crown for consideration of charges.
<p>The British Columbia C Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) has raised questions of “racial bias” and excessive force by RCMP officers in the arrest of Dale Culver (35) of the Wet’suwet’en and Gitxsan First Nations who died in custody following the arrest in July 2017. In an official complaint filed January 16, 2018, to the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP, the BCCLA also claims that the RCMP in Prince George, BC, told witnesses to delete video footage of the Culver arrest. According to police reports, Culver complained of shortness of breath after arrest and was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Culver’s cousin, Debbie Pierre, said she was not informed of his death until 24 hours later. She then found video footage of the arrest posted on social media. In her words: “It was horrific” (quoted in Kurjata and McKinnon 2018). The family had questions about Culver’s death and contacted the BCCLA to get some answers.</p>
<p>Police reports suggest the RCMP responded to a call about a man allegedly “casing vehicles.” This claim has not been independently confirmed nor has it been explained what that assumption was based on by caller or police. Police struggled with Culver physically.</p>
<p>It is reported that pepper spray used in Culver’s arrest. When he was put in the back of a police vehicle he appeared to have difficulty breathing. An ambulance was called and Culver collapsed when taken out of the police car. He was pronounced dead in hospital a bit after midnight on July 19, 2017.</p>
<p>According to executive director Josh Paterson, BCCLA has spoken with “a number of people, including eyewitnesses” who allege RCMP instructed people to delete video footage of the arrest (Kurjata and McKinnon 2018). The association questions whether “explicit or  implicit racial  bias” played a role in the encounter and arrest. BCCLA says it has been told there were “several hours” between the initial call to police and the arrival of RCMP on the scene (Kurjata and McKinnon 2018). This raises obvious questions about Culver was approached and, specifically, whether it was because he was Indigenous.</p>
<p>In the words of the BCCLA complaint:</p>
<p>“We question on what information or basis the member or members of the RCMP began their interaction or questioning of Mr. Culver, and/or a request to identify himself, in the first place.” (quoted in Kurjata and McKinnon 2018)</p>
<p>Debbie Pierre is left with the same question. In her words: “Was Dale targeted because of Dale or was he targeted because of his being Indigenous” (quoted in Kurjata and McKinnon 2018).</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office of BC (IIO) is also investigating, as it does in cases of police harm to civilians in the province. IIO chief civilian director Ron MacDonald says the IIO was independently aware of allegations of witnesses being told to delete video footage. He also said the IIO was aware of questions regardding police use of force and the timing of Culver’s arrest.</p>
<p>Culver had three children, the eldest of whom is now 14.</p>

<p>The man who died while in custody of Prince George RCMP has been identified publicly as Dale Culver, a 35-year-old father of three. Several RCMP officers took part in Culver’s arrest allegedly following a call about someone looking at vehicles. Culver was pepper prayed and newly released video shows that four officers pinned him to the ground afterwards.</p>
<p>It has not been independently confirmed that Culver, or anyone else was “casing vehicles.” Yet on this basis he was killed by police. A terrible price to pay for simply being suspected of possibly looking at cars.</p>
<p>Seeing the video, Alicia Wisla, Culver’s partner and mother of their five-month-old child, insists the officers involved must be charged.</p>

An independent investigation of the fatal shooting is underway.; David Sappa refused to leave his home when officers arrived to arrest him. While one officer left to get a warrant, Sappa left armed with a knife in each hand. The BEI investigation found that Sappa moved through the community, threatening people and yelling at police officers to “shoot me.” Three officers followed him and used pepper spray. But as a family member tried to disarm Sappa, he became more aggressive and lunged at one of the officers. The police then opened fire. He died that evening at a health centre. The officers were cleared of any wrongdoing. According to the coroner, Sappa's death could have been avoided. In his report, the coroner denounced the lack of Inuit police officers within the force. It also contradicts reports by the BEI and the Director of Public Prosecutions, which say that Sappa threatened people in the community.

<p>Saskatchewan RCMP shot and killed 22-year-old Brydon Bryce Whitstone of Onion Lake Cree Nation around 9 PM on the evening of Saturday, October 21, 2017, in North Battleford.</p>
<p>RCMP have reported that they received a call from a man, saying he had been chased and shot at from a vehicle.  Police located the suspected vehicle and gave pursuit until they immobilized the vehicle. During their interaction with the driver shots were fired injuring a man inside the vehicle.  The victim, now identified as Brydon Bryce Whitstone, was pronounced dead at around 9:40 PM, while en route to hospital.</p>
<p>RCMP also report that a woman inside the vehicle suffered minor injuries. She was taken to hospital, but then released into police custody. Neither her condition nor the specific reason she was taken into custody have been reported publicly at this time. Neither has it been reported publicly how many shots were fired by RCMP officers. None of the police claims have been independently confirmed.</p>
<p>There is no independent investigative unit In Saskatchewan to examine cases of police harm to civilians in the province. RCMP Chief Superintendent Maureen Levy has reported that the Regina Police Service is now investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing of Whitstone by RCMP officers.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan’s Ministry of Justice will also appoint what it calls an independent observer to oversee the investigation, but such observers are almost always former police officers, so in no way independent. Justice Ministry spokesman Drew Wilby explained at a news conference that in cases were an independent observer is requested, the ministry appoints someone such as a former police officer. Yet, Wilby suggested, incredulously, that, “This individual will not be connected to the RCMP.” But it could well be a fellow officer so no claims of independence have any credibility.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan RCMP are a directly colonial military force. It remains a force of settler colonial military occupation of Indigenous lands and has an ongoing history of violence against Indigenous people and communities.</p>

Worried about Wesley's erratic behaviour, a nurse called police. Wesley was pepper-sprayed, tackled, hit with batons and handcuffed by two officers. Soon after, Wesley stopped breathing and died. A coroner's report found Wesley's death was caused by a combination of the restraint, Wesley's agitation, and acute alcohol withdrawal. An inquest, held in 2017 and supported by members of Wesley's First Nation community, ruled his death accidental.
<p>Romeo Wesley (34), of Cat Lake First Nation, died after being pepper sprayed, beaten, handcuffed, and stepped on by two police officers in his community’s nursing station in 2010. On July 20, 2017 the coroner’s inquest into his killing by police was released and concluded incredibly that his death was accidental. Now for most reasonable people if a civilian pepper sprayed, beat, restrained, and stepped on someone and they died it would not be viewed as an accident. Death would be recognized as a probability outcome of those actions being inflicted on someone.</p>
<p>Wesley had gone to the nursing station, in the community 400 kilometers north of Thunder Bay, concerned about shortness of breath and looking for help. A nurse there viewed his behavior as erratic (one would think acting erratically is not atypical for someone in medical distress) and called Nishawbe-Aski police.</p>
<p>The two officers who arrived pepper sprayed Wesley, tackled him onto the floor, beat him with a baton, and handcuffed his hands behind him. With police forcing him face down on the floor and with their boots on his head, neck, and back, Wesley stopped breathing. The inquest determined this to be an accident but we might reasonable ask if he would have died in the absence of this police assault.</p>
<p>None of the medical staff at the nursing station, including the doctor and nurses, did anything to help Wesley, perhaps fearful of police response if they tried. They only checked on him after he stopped breathing.</p>
<p>The coroner’s inquest, in a manner not unique in cases of police killing civilians, decided to blame the victim in their ruling. They found the cause of Wesley’s death to be “struggle and restraint (chest compression, prone positioning, handcuffing) as well as agitation and trauma (pain)&#8230;.with acute alcohol withdrawal/delirium tremens.” Restraint, agitation, and trauma are all directly attributable to actions taken by the police officers. These were not accidents.</p>
<p>The jury made 53 recommendations. Some of them highlight systemic racism within government services in Indigenous communities (without actually naming racism). They include:</p>
<p>Cultural training courses for nurses before being placed in an Indigenous community.</p>
<p>Hiring medical staff and police officers who speak the language of the communities they serve.</p>
<p>Developing a protocol for police interventions in medical facilities within Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Designating Nishnawbe-Aski Police Services as a police force under the Police Services Act in Ontario and thus providing for some civilian oversight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

In an initial report, independent investigators said Saidi died after an ‚Äúinteraction‚Äù with officers that ended when one of the officers shot Saidi. Police said the fatal shooting was the result of an ‚Äúaltercation‚Äù with officers. An independent investigation is underway.; Babak Saidi, 43, arrived at a police detachment for his weekly check-in, the result of a 2014 conviction for assault. Saidi was shot dead less than two minutes after he entered the OPP station. According to the SIU report, as two officers tried to arrest Saidi on new charges, he tried to exit the building. The officers pursued him and tried to grab Saidi from behind. They fired a taser that failed to work and Saidi managed to grab hold of the weapon, says the report. In that moment, one officer fired his gun and Saidi was shot three times. Saidi had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and was taking medication for it. The SIU cleared the officers of any wrongdoing. But a coroner's inquest was set to launch but has been delayed until further notice. 
<p>Babak Saidi was shot and killed by Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) outside their Morrisburg detachment only minutes after his father dropped him off for a scheduled probation check-in on December 23, 2017. While little has been reported publicly about the details of the killing, as it rarely is in cases of police killings in Canada, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has designates a lone subject officer in their investigation. This means they believe that a sole officer fired the shot(s) that struck and killed Babak Saidi that day. As is unfortunately the standard practice in Canada the officer responsible for the killing has not been identified publicly. Saidi’s killing is being investigated by the provincial police watchdog, the Special Investigations Unit, which has assigned four investigators and three forensic specialists to the case.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old Saidi, whose was born in Iran but came to Canada as a refugee with his family, had been diagnosed with late onset schizophrenia and social paranoia according to his family. They are looking for answers and for mechanisms to address the ongoing use of violence by police toward people experiencing mental health issues.</p>
<p>In the words of Babak Saidi’s sister, Elly Saidi:  “This is yet another shocking example of a lethal police response to an unarmed person with mental health disabilities. I want everyone to learn from this tragic experience” (quoted in Duffy 2018).</p>
<p>Babak Saidi had gone to the same OPP station more than 30 times — every week for nine months — in 2017. Elly Saidi says that the family remains very much in the dark about why his routine check-in at the police station so quickly turned deadly. In her words “It would be good to get an explanation for what happened. I don’t know what instigated it: Why this time was so different than every other time?” (quoted in Duffy 2018).</p>
<p>Saidi’s father, Mehrab Saidi (83), has reported hearing “multiple gunshots” while in his car, moments after dropping off his son at the detachment. He has also said that he was instructed by police to wait at a nearby coffee shop for more information and was only notified of his sons death hours later.</p>
<p>Elly Saidi is chief executive of United World Voices, a registered charity in Ottawa that works with homeless youth and vulnerable women. She says her brother was only diagnosed with schizophrenia early in 2017 as the family had not been able to get a diagnosis for him. In her words: “We told lawyers for many years he needs help. Like a lot of people in his position, they fall through the cracks. He should have been assessed and treated much earlier. We knew there was something wrong with him, but it was hard to get anyone to listen. That’s the frustrating part” (quoted in Duffy 2018).</p>
<p>In the view of Elly Saidi her brother should not have died in the encounter:</p>
<p>“What is beyond doubt is that OPP members involved in this tragedy were unable to peacefully de-escalate this situation. The OPP resorted to a lethal response to an unarmed individual with mental disabilities. I know that things can escalate from zero to 100 in a few seconds with mentally ill people. The police need to know how to deal with that, how to de-escalate and contain the situation.” (quoted in Duffy 2018)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, Babak Saidi had publicly reported feeling harassed by local police in Brockville, Ontario, where he lived. During a 2003 court hearing, Saidi, then 29, told a judge that police in Brockville “have been on my ass for 10 years” (quoted in Duffy 2018). He continued, telling Ontario Court Justice Charles Anderson : “They don’t like me and I don’t like them” (quoted in Duffy 2018).</p>
<p>In 2017 Ontario’s Office of the Independent Police Review Director compiled records showing that 142 people were fatally shot during interactions with police between January 1990 and December 2016 (Duffy 2018). Calls for de-escalation training have been made repeatedly in studies and reviews on police violence and mental health with no meaningful improvements. At the end of the day police remain the unaccountable monopoly on violence acting with impunity in communities.</p>

<p>Many disturbing questions remain after Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) shot and killed 43-year-old Babak Saidi inside the detachment in Morrisburg, Ontario on Saturday, December 23, 2017. Saidi, who experienced schizophrenia, was under conditions to check in weekly at the detachment following a 2014 conviction for assault and battery. He had been making those weekly check-ins regularly before something went deeply wrong during the December 23 check-in. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that investigates police harm to civilians in Ontario, is investigating. They have assigned seven investigators to the scene. Morrisburg is 80 milometers south of the nation’s capital, Ottawa.</p>
<p>Babak Saidi headed to the Saturday morning check-in with a tin full of freshly baked muffins, a Christmas gift for his father and a family friend who were providing his ride to the detachment. For family, the muffins were a sign that Babak Saidi was in a good mood. Hi sister, Elly Saidi remembers him fondly: “My brother, he was the kindest, sweetest, most loving person. He had a mental disability, and we need to know how to deal with a person with mental disability” (quoted in Pritchard 2017).</p>
<p>Few details have been released publicly regarding what happened at the detachment, but his sister has provided her father’s view of events as he experienced and witnessed them. Elly Saidi reports that, according to her father, the three were told to wait about 15 minutes when they arrived at the police station. They decided to go do some grocery shopping, and when they returned, Babak Saidi left the car to go inside. In very short order the father would see his son the ground, with two officers on top of him. Babak Saidi was taken into the detachment by officers and, according to the father, two shots were heard within two minutes. The SIU has confirmed that Babak Saidi was the person struck by the officer fired shots and that he was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Oddly,  a police officer then told Saidi’s father and his friend to go to a nearby Tim Hortons and wait until someone arrived to explain what happened. After a few hours, police finally arrived to deliver an awful message in an apparently cold manner. According to Elly Saidi: “They waited for a few hours, and then the police came. My dad asked the police, ‘Where is my son?’ And the police officer told my dad that, sorry, your son is gone” (quoted in Pritchard 2017).</p>
<p>This was all the family was told about what happened, a full ten hours after the shooting. The family says this delay and the ongoing lack of information are “unacceptable.” They are, sadly, too common in cases of police killings of civilians in Canada.</p>
<p>In Elly Said’s words: “I have to be strong for my parents. It’s very hard to see my mom and my dad crying and being heartbroken. My mom was sitting in a corner of the room, hugging my brother’s picture. And all she’s saying is, ‘I don’t know what happened. I don’t know where his body is’” (quoted in Pritchard 2017). A worker with homeless youth in Ottawa, she says she needs to speak out because of the numerous cases of police violence, including lethal violence, inflicted on people with mental health issues in Canadian contexts. Reflecting on police in Canada, she says:</p>
<p>“They have absolutely no tools and no awareness to deal with people with mental disability. Too many people with mental disabilities have died at the hands of the police. They need to have education and awareness [of] how to deal with people with mental disability. And not [assume] they&#8217;re all bad and a menace to society.” (quoted in Pritchard 2017)</p>
<p>The SIU has reported that they will be interviewing the subject officer as well as 10 officers who were witnesses. One can only imagine how police witnesses to police killings will report events. There have been issues with timelines for interviewing police officers following police involved killings, with no assurances that officers will not compare and fix their stories.</p>

0603-V1,"The jury at the inquest found that Gray died of'gunshot wounds to the torso.' It ruled the death homicide, which in a coroner's inquest means a death as aesult of the purposeful actions of another person and does not carry any criminal connotations.
<p>Six years after Brian Gray, 39, was killed by members of the Ontario Provincial Police Emergency Response Team at Whitefish Bay on the Lac Seul First Nation in Northern Ontario, the jury in the coroner’s inquest into his killing has released its recommendations. These show both the delay in responding to police killings in Canada as well as the limited framework for addressing police violence and lethal force.</p>
<p>The coroner’s inquest noted that officers took more than four hours to each the residence at Whitefish Bay after the initial call was made reporting an incident at the home, May 9, 2010. This became notable for the jury because by the time the Emergency Response Team arrived the situation had escalated well beyond the incident that gave rise to the call to police. Indeed Gray had taken time to leave the site of the initial incident on at least one occasion returning to his own home before returning.</p>
<p>According to the initial report of the provincial police oversight body, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) Gray had actually released a hostage right before police responded by shooting him several times killing him. He apparently gave out a large scream right before he was shot but one would hope this did not startle officers causing a panicked response. Gray was still conscious after being shot and police handcuffed him before taking him to an ambulance. He died at the Sioux Lookout Meno Ya Win Health Centre. In any event the SIU, not surprisingly, determined that the police execution of Gray was justified. They cleared three OPP officers involved in killing Gray.</p>
<p>The coroner’s inquest jury found that Brian Gray was killed died as a result of multiple &#8220;gunshot wounds to the torso&#8221; (Porter 2016). The jury ruled Gray’s death to be a homicide. In this context the ruling means that the death is “a result of the purposeful actions of another person and does not carry any criminal connotations” (Porter 2016).</p>
<p>The jury made 18 recommendations with regard to the inquiry in Gray’s killing and these did recognize the problems within the O.P.P in terms of aboriginal awareness and interactions with indigenous civilians. As is disproportionately the case in incidents of lethal police violence against civilians the person killed is experiencing a mental health issue that finds a response not in care but in policing. Among the 18 recommendations issued by the jury are these:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Options for more effective tactical response should be explored, including but not limited to enhanced Emergency Response Team (ERT) training, upgrading the North Western Region ERT team to level 2 Tactical capabilities, and placing a Tactics and Rescue unit (TRU) team in Northern Ontario.</p>
<p>The OPP should ensure that all members working with aboriginal communities and people receive Aboriginal Awareness Training that should be updated when necessary.</p>
<p>When OPP Officers are deployed in a location where they might be expected to attend on a First Nation, they should attend and be familiarized with that First Nation soon after being deployed to that Detachment.</p>
<p>When a critical incident occurs, an individual or individuals should be identified by Lac Seul First Nation to liaise between the police, First Nation and family of the subject, for the purpose of improving communication, and keeping the families informed of the progress of an incident.</p>
<p>Lac Seul First Nation should receive funding to hire a certified mental health counsellor, to hire and train additional mental health workers, to train its existing mental health workers, and to increase awareness of mental health issues and to initiate early intervention within the community.” (Porter 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the recommendations from a coroner&#8217;s inquest are binding.</p>

0509-V1,"Paramedics called police after Joey Knapaysweet entered an ambulance bay and said he wanted to be shot in the head. He threatened his own life with knives he was carrying, and eventually paramedics were able to convince him to leave the building. According to an SIU report, Knapaysweet lunged at a police officer who made contact with him in a back parking lot. Knapaysweet fled and a second officer chased him onto a frozen lake. The report states Knapaysweet refused to drop his knife and lunged at the officer who fired four shots, killing him.
<p>Police in the small northern Ontario city of Timmins, shot and killed 21-year-old Joey Knapaysweet on February 3, 2018. In a context, as is true across Canada, in which police control information about their killings, few details have been provided publicly. Joey Knapaysweet was from the James Bay community of Fort Albany — more than an hour’s flight from Timmins. According to the family statement, he had gone to Timmins to “seek help in dreams for betterment of his life.” On Thursday, February 15, the family released a statement from Fort Albany saying they need answers about why police chose to kill their loved one.</p>
<p>Micheline Knapaysweet expresses her pain:  “I cannot sleep at nights, I need answers. This is my son, my child.” She asks further “What did he do that was so bad that he had to be shot and killed? I am so heartbroken, with so many questions unanswered.”</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit, the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario has only said: “There was an interaction between the man and officers, and one of the officers discharged a firearm. The man was struck. He was taken to hospital where he was later pronounced dead.”</p>
<p>The police killing of Joey Knapaysweet occurred the same weekend as another Cree person from Fort Albany, 62-year-old Agnes Sutherland, died in custody of Timmins police. Their deaths through police interactions, happened as an all-white jury in Saskatchewan was about to acquit white farmer Gerald Stanley in the 2016 killing of a young Cree man, Colten Boushie. The Stanley trial and acquittal brought international attention to white supremacy, colonialism, and racism in Canada and Canadian criminal justice. The Stanley verdict sparked protests across the country against the mistreatment of Indigenous people throughout the justice system in Canada.</p>
<p>Might the deaths of Joey Knapaysweet and Agnes Sutherland spark further actions and calls for systemic transformation. In Timmins a vigil before the Stanley trial verdict brought out at least 100 people. Micheline Knapaysweet has made a dedication to wear a red scarf, Joey Knapaysweet’s favorite color, until the family receives need answers to their questions.</p>

<p>There is growing outrage, and mounting questions, after a deadly weekend in which two Indigenous people were left dead following encounters with Timmins, Ontario, police. Police in the small northern Ontario city shot and killed Joey Knapaysweet, 21, on Saturday, February 3, 2018. Then, on Sunday, February 4, Agnes Sutherland, 62, died in police custody. Both victims were from Fort Albany First Nation, a James Bay community.</p>
<p>Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents nearly 50 Indigenous communities in northern Ontario, expressed great concern over the two deaths in two days. In his words: “It’s very troubling. The families have a lot of questions” (quoted in Perkel 2018).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deaths at the Hands of Police</p>
<p>Details about both deaths are limited so far. Police control information about their killings and deaths related to their activities. This is a problem across Canada in terms of policing. Police did not release the names of their victims. The names were conformed by multiple other sources, including federal Member of Parliament Charlie Angus.</p>
<p>With regard to the police shooting of Joey Knapaysweet, the province’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has only said that  there was “an interaction” between officers and the victim and an officer discharged a firearm striking the man.</p>
<p>Agnes Sutherland was arrested at a shelter after having been asked to leave the Timmins District Hospital, where she had sought help. She was taken to a police station and put in a cell on Saturday, the same day Knapaysweet was killed. Later that same evening she was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead late Sunday.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by Indigenous leaders Grand Chief Fiddler, Grand Chief Jonathan Solomon of the Mushkegowuk Council, and Fort Albany First Nation Chief Andrew Solomon, serious questions are raised: “It is alleged that when police attended at the scene of the local shelter, Ms. Sutherland was treated roughly while being taken into police custody. She suffered severe complications during her detention” (quoted in Perkel 2018).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Systemic Racism and Colonial Legacies</p>
<p>In their statement, Grand Chief Fiddler, Grand Chief Solomon and Chief Andrew Solomon call for a timely and thorough investigation. They raise the very real issues of racism in policing and the violence targeted at Indigenous people by police. In their words: “We have seen systemic racism in the city of Thunder Bay, and must now wonder if this is also happening in Timmins” (quoted in Perkel 2018).</p>
<p>Notably, Timmins Mayor Steve Black acknowledged that the deaths at the hands of police had increased racial tensions in the city, though he did not specify. He said: “I don’t believe there’s room for racism in any community. If changes need to be made or things need to be done to improve those relationships, we’re definitely willing to work with our partners on improving those relationships” (quoted in Perkel 2018). No word on whether that includes dismantling settler colonial police forces (or mayoralties). He has, though, condemned people who have spoken out against the police and their actions on social media (CBC News 2018).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Health Care Not Cops</p>
<p>According to the Chiefs, both victims had left the remote community of Fort Albany, near Ontario’s James Bay coast, to seek medical care in Timmins. They note in their statement: “Our people must continually leave their families and communities to come to cities to seek services that are not available in their respective communities” (quoted in 2018). The deaths come as an emergency summit is being held in Timmins by the Mushkegowuk Council this week. The regional James Bay government declared a state of emergency in November, concerned over the growing number of drugs and alcohol coming into its seven member communities (CBC News 2018).</p>
<p>Sutherland’s son, Glen Sutherland, told the <em>Timmins Daily Press</em> that his mother was a survivor of the notorious St. Anne’s residential school. He said that she needed a wheelchair to get around, and questioned the actions of hospital staff. She was using a wheelchair at the time of her arrest. Glen Sutherland said that her frequent trips to the emergency room were a cry for help (Perkel 2018). She was a mother of six with six great grandchildren.</p>
<p>The mistreatment at hospitals of Indigenous people seeking medical assistance has been a disturbing, and too common, issue in various locations in Canada, including infamous cases in Winnipeg, Manitoba that have gained some national attention. It speaks to ongoing legacies of colonialism and racism in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>A vigil in Timmins for Knapaysweet on Tuesday, February 6, drew around 100 people. Chief Andrew Solomon is calling on the Attorney General of Ontario and the Minister of Community Safety to investigate the Timmins Police (CBC News 2018).</p>
<p>Police and criminal justice systems more broadly in Canada disproportionately target Indigenous people and disproportionately target them for violence. Criminal justice systems, including police forces, were founded as instruments of settler colonialism, occupation, dispossession, and displacement and this must always be front and center in discussions of policing in the country.</p>

 officers after a 43-year-old Harris Drive man died after being tasered in his bedroom during an arrest last
 year.
<p>The family of Gordon Couvrette (43), who was tased and killed by North Bay police, disputes the police account of their activities. They also say they warned police that Couvrette had a heart condition and that tasing him could be fatal. This according to a report by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) which is investigating the killing. It is reported that Couvrette died of a heart attack.</p>
<p>Police claim they were called to the scene of a domestic incident early on the morning of February 22, 2018. A friend close to the Couvrette family, Emma Higgins, disputes that account of the situation. In her words, as reported by the SIU:</p>
<p>“He [Couvrette] woke up from sleep delirious from his bipolar medication and thought someone broke in so he started yelling trying to scare the ‘intruder’ protecting his girlfriend. She and her son told the cops that they can’t taze him he’s bipolar and on medication for it and his heart can’t take it and that he was doing no harm.”</p>
<p>Despite the words of those who knew and lived with Couvrette police moved to arrest the man. In the course of the arrest they used a taser.</p>

He took one of the knives from the block and began slashing at an officer. Moving backward, the officer fell and Mahoney continued to advance, cutting the officer's hand. Mahoney then turned his attention to a second officer that had arrived. As he advanced, both officers fired a combined seven bullets. Mahoney suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was sent to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
<p>Family members have identified Matthew Mahoney as the 33-year-old man shot multiple times and killed by Windsor police on March 21, 2018. They say that he struggled with schizophrenia and other mental health issues.</p>
<p>In a interview with CBC News, older brother Michael Mahoney says a lack of resources in healthcare and limits to the legal system failed his brother. He also noted the inappropriateness and unsuitability of police dealing with mental health issues. In his words:</p>
<p>“Our police aren&#8217;t trained to deal with people who are suffering the way my brother is. That can make it really hard when they encounter someone like him. You’re not sure  if this person is dangerous or just needs a hug. I think my brother needed a hug that morning. I wish I could have been there.” (quoted in Taekema 2018)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, confirmed on March 23 that Matthew Mahoney was shot by two officers who discharged firearms and “struck multiple times.” The SIU has identified eight witness officers in addition to the two subject officers, suggesting that at least ten officers confronted the victim on the street.</p>
<p>This leaves the family with many questions. Said Michael Mahoney:</p>
<p>“We definitely want to know what my brother was going through that morning. We want to know how the police became involved and we want to know that they did everything they could to deescalate the situation. Right now we’re just trying to focus on remembering Matthew the way we remember him and we&#8217;re trying not to think about that morning because your mind just races and there’s no answers right now.” (quoted in Taekema 2018)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He reports that his brother’s mental health struggles, developing as a teenager, worsened as he became an adult. While medications offered some help, he was extremely fearful of authorities, a not unreasonable feeling. Michael Mahoney relates:</p>
<p>“Being in the health care system can be extremely terrifying, extremely dangerous and he did everything in his life to try to avoid going back to hospital. Every decision he made was to try to avoid interactions with police or mental health services. They were his biggest fears.” (quoted in Taekema 2018)</p>
<p>Matthew Mahoney needed care and a hug not cops and bullets. Michael Mahoney is left to conclude: “The system just isn’t set up right to help people with extreme needs like my brother&#8230;This didn’t need to happen” (quoted in Taekema 2018). Even worse, in the end the system actively killed Matthew Mahoney.</p>

<p>“He came to the community here all the time to hang out, he never really bothered anybody. Apart from that, he had been living with a lot of challenges, including mental health, language barriers, adjustment to this new community.” (quoted in CBC News 2019)</p>
<p>The Council of South Sudanese Community of Manitoba had been working with health services, including the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority and Manitoba’s Employment and Income Assistance Program, to help Madut with his mental health issues.</p>
<p>On Saturday, before he was shot by police, Madut had been moving furniture out of his apartment for as yet unknown reasons. A cousin, Ayei Madut, said the man had been dealing with a broken door in his apartment.</p>
<p>Ayei Madut also questions why police responded , and so immediately, with lethal force. In his words:</p>
<p>“I’m really not trusting the police, because we assume they have all the resource how to deal with people with mental issues, with different background. For me I can’t even trust them because this situation, I could do it better than whatever they did.” (quoted in CBC News 2019)</p>
<p>Alexa Potashnik, president of Black Space Winnipeg, also directed skepticism toward Winnipeg police. As she notes: “This just unfortunately is a reminder that police brutality and violence happens in all areas across our country and we need answers” (quoted in CBC News 2019).</p>
<p>She adds that violence against Black people by police must be addressed in Winnipeg. In her view:</p>
<p>“There’s no justice or accountability from the Winnipeg police department and this is unacceptable and it’s an inexcusable act of violence toward the South Sudanese community, toward the black community. We’re not going to take this lying down and we’re going to show up and demand justice for our community.” (quoted in CBC News 2019)</p>
<p>The killing by police of a Black man and man experiencing mental health distress highlights ongoing issues of police violence and use of lethal force in Canada.</p>
<p>The Council of South Sudanese Community of Manitoba will hold a rally outside police headquarters on March 1 to demand answers “and shed light into the gaps that we have in mental health services and how police officers might not be well-equipped to deal with people with mental health issues and language barriers” (quoted in CBC News 2019).</p>
<p>Machuar Mawien Madut is the third person shot by Winnipeg police already in 2019.</p>

0580-V2,"Officers arrived at a residence after receiving calls that Randy Crosson had fired a gun and was holding Nona Marnie McEwan hostage. A standoff lasting 10 hours ensued. Crosson said he was going to kill McEwan, according to police, and so they stormed the residence. They found Crosson laying on a bed with McEwan on top of him. He had a knife to her throat and a gun in the other hand. Officers shot Crosson multiple times, and he died. Some bullets also struck McEwan, killing her. An IIO investigation absolved the officers of wrongdoing.
<p>Once again killer cops get off. The Independent Investigations Office of BC (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia, has announced that it will not be recommending charges against the RCMP officers who shot and killed Nona McEwan and Randy Crosson on March 29, 2019 in a home on the 13300 block of 98A Street in Surrey. The decision was made public on April 1, 2020. Four officers were directly involved in the killings. None have been named publicly. The IIO reports that the officers fired over forty rounds, in close quarters. Forty.</p>
<p>Police described the context of the killings as a “hostage taking.” For over a month after the killings, RCMP publicly implied that Randy Crosson had killed Nona McEwan.</p>
<p>When asked directly in 2019 if he could say conclusively that a police bullet did not hit Nona McEwan, the Surrey Now-Leader reported that Integrated Homicide Investigation Team spokesperson Corporal Frank Jang replied:</p>
<p>“No, I mean that’s all part of the investigation that’s happening now. There will be updates coming forth from the IIO but all those details, the exact mechanism, entries, where the shots came from, that’s all going to be part of the investigation. I can’t comment further because it’s still ongoing.”</p>
<p>Not long afterward the lie was put to the police portrayal when the IIO reported that RCMP had shot and killed both McEwan and Crosson. Clearly, officers at the scene, and IHIT member Jang must have known that police had done the shooting. One might also figure that they knew this as they made statements over a month that posed Crosson as potentially the killer.</p>
<p>The IIO concluded that Crosson “provoked an armed response from police aimed at saving her.” A rather incredible statement given that firing at McEwan, striking, and killing her can in no way credibly be described as a response aimed at “saving her.”</p>
<p>The IIO, which is not a truly independent body and has had former officers among its members as well as relying on police for training, interviewed 38 witness police officers to determine that none of the four officers directly involved committed any criminal offense. Any criminal offense. Not at all surprising given that killer cops are virtually never held anywhere near accountable when they kill in Canada.</p>

<p>Many questions have been unanswered since two people, later identified as Nona McEwan and Randy Crosson, were killed during an alleged hostage taking and police standoff in Surrey, British Columbia on March 29, 2019. Foremost among these was whether RCMP officers actually fired the fatal shots, killing both people. Police have been notably silent on that question all the while putting out a public narrative that they used lethal force to save a hostage who was probably killed by the hostage taker. On May 2 the horrible answer finally came. The Independent Investigations Office of British Columbia (IIO) has publicly confirmed that both Nona McEwan and Randy Crosson were killed by multiple shots fired by the RCMP.</p>
<p>Initial reports suggested that both had been shot with Crosson dying at the scene and McEwan dying later in hospital. Police alleged that Crosson had taken McEwan hostage and implied that police violence was necessary to save the hostage.</p>

The 77-year-old resisted, refusing to leave his home, according to Quebec's BEI. Police deployed pepper spray, handcuffed him and then saw that he was having trouble breathing. An ambulance was called. D'amour died in hospital. The autopsy report states cause of death was a burst artery, not the application of force by police. The BEI found that there was reason to suspect wrongdoing and provided their notes to the Crown for consideration. ",Deadly Force (2020),
0519-V1,"Police arrived at Benjamin Richard's residence after receiving reports of a man shooting out the windows of his home. An unidentified witness who fled the home said she saw two officers running toward it; one was holding a rifle. Officers heard bullets strike the police truck of a third officer as they drove from the front to the back of Richard's residence. The officers say that Richard exited his home, rifle in hand, and aimed at one of them. A total of 17 shots were fired from rifles held by two officers. Richards was struck five times.
<p>Manitoba First Nations Police shot and killed 23-year-old Benjamin Richard on Long Plain First Nation on the evening of April 2, 2019. The victim’s identity was confirmed publicly by his sister Patricia Richard. She reports that she called police after speaking with her mother because she believed her brother to be ‘freaking out’ and shooting out of the house where her mother lives.</p>
<p>Patricia Richard had hoped police would protect her brother, not shoot him. She is upset at how police handled the situation, believing it could have and should have ended differently.</p>
<p>She has since said that her mother told her: “They went rushing in there. Everything happened too quick. She said they didn’t have to [shoot him]. He wasn’t threatening anyone, he just snapped on himself” (quoted in CBC News 2019)</p>
<p>The victim’s niece, Tammy Smith, said she was outside the house in a pickup truck with Richard’s mother when three officers spotted Richard through a window and started shooting at him. She describes a chaotic, reckless, rush to lethal force. In her words: “I was backing up to see if I could see Ben, when all the shots came from the (police). I’m pretty sure they all unloaded their clips. We just started screaming” (quoted in Rollason 2019).</p>
<p>She echoed the family’s feelings of anger over how the situation was handled: “It should not have escalated to that point. They should have waited for more people. They should have tried to wait it out. They were all outside, shooting through the walls and windows. They never even entered the house&#8230;” (quoted in Rollason 2019)</p>
<p>Witnesses suggest that the victim was only firing his weapon into an empty field and the ceiling of the house. They say he posed no threat to anyone, but was simply upset. She relates: &#8220;His mother, last week, called the [police] to take him to the hospital so he could be assessed. But when they came and talked to him, they said he wasn’t a threat to anyone. Then a week later, they come back and shoot him” (quoted in Rollason 2019).</p>
<p>Patricia Richard has said that in her view the officers were “trigger-happy.” She suggests: “They knew my brother needed help a few days before anything happened. He was unstable. Everyone saw the signs” (quoted in Rollason 2019).</p>
<p>And she concludes: “I believe what happened could have been 100 per cent preventable” (quoted in Rollason 2019).</p>
<p>Smith remembers Benjamin Richard in these terms: “He was kind, caring and always thinking of others more than himself. The world lost a great man. My heart breaks” (quoted in Macdonnell 2019).</p>
<p>According to the Independent Investigation Unit (IIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Manitoba, it was notified by Manitoba First Nations Police that officers had responded to a report of a man armed with a firearm in a residence at around 6 PM. During an encounter at least one office fired a weapon, striking the man. The victim, Benjamin Richard was pronounced dead on the scene. Three officers involved in the case are now on administrative leave.</p>

<p>Fiddler’s family is demanding justice. They question the quick violence of the Calgary police. Mario Fiddler, the victim’s cousin, says:</p>
<p>“We believe Robin didn’t deserve to die — we want to see justice. We believe the Calgary police officer could’ve taken different steps dealing with Robin (and that) a Taser could’ve been used instead of shooting our cousin. My cousin isn’t the type of person to be an aggressor.” (quoted in Laing 2019).</p>
<p>Another cousin, Angela Fiddler, has reflected on Robin Fiddler’s determination and humor. In her words:</p>
<p>“She always tried to get through whatever systemic barriers that she faced — she always tried to make a way. She was just a blessing to us. It was her smile, she was always so funny and she always wanted to make people laugh.<br />
“When we were both younger, I just took her under my wing and that was that. She would come live with me when she had the opportunity. I’ve always had an open door for her. Robin was a beautiful soul, she deserved to live.”</p>
<p>Calgary police Chief Mark Neufeld has said that the officer who killed Fiddler was wearing a police-issued, body-worn camera at the time of the killing. No video has been released publicly. Robin Fiddler’s killing is at least the third police-involved death in Calgary in 2019.</p>

Maple Ridge News reported that a neighbour recalled hearing two loud bangs and police say one officer fired a weapon. Din had a knife when officers confronted him, according to police. His family, on the other hand, says he only had a glass bottle. An investigation is ongoing.
<p>British Columbia RCMP shot and killed a man who has been identified by family members as Kyaw Din (54) at a Maple Ridge home on August 11, 2019. The killing took place at a home in the area of Colemore Street and 124 Avenue.</p>
<p>Family members have spoken publicly to say that the victim had a history of mental illness and had been between hospital and home over a period of some time. His brother Thant Din reports that Kyaw Din had forgotten or refused to take his medication the Sunday he was killed. According to Din: “In the past, my sister would call police, and police would come and take him to hospital. So today my sister called police, but he didn’t want to go” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Din reports that his brother had barricaded himself in his room and refused to leave when police arrived. He says that his sister asked that he and other siblings come to come to Maple Ridge from Coquitlam to help translate between their brother and police (Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Din recalls the frustration of conversations with police. In his words: “My sister told police, ‘Don’t do anything, they’re 15 minutes away, they’re on their way.’ When we show up, there’s police tape and we can’t go inside” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>He expresses his horror over police actions toward his brother: “They shot him. They shot him point blank. They unnecessarily killed someone” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Kyaw Din’s sister Yin Yin reports that she was told by police to wait outside the home. She then heard three shots. Incredibly, three officers came outside of the home “about an hour later,” but left the scene before she could talk with them (Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>She reports publicly her conversation with police: “They asked me if my brother has a gun. He doesn’t have a gun. He doesn’t have a knife. He’s just in the room and I told the police he has a glass bottle that he might throw at you. I don’t want you to get hurt and I don&#8217;t want the police to shoot my brother” (quoted in Holliday 2019).</p>
<p>She insists that police deceived her and the family: “They lied to me. They promised me, ‘we would never shoot your brother, we deal with this all the time,’ and they shot him” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>She is left only to ponder, in sorrow: “For no reason, they shot him. Can you imagine? Brother was doing housework in the morning and now he is dead” (quoted in Holliday 2019)</p>
<p>Thant Din Thant tells reporters that his brother was sometimes loud and confrontational when not taking his medicine, but he never saw Kyaw Din become violent. According to Thant Din: “He never hit anybody. He might be screaming and yelling, but he never hit anybody” (quoted in Holliday 2019).</p>
<p>Thant Din is angry and wants to see police held accountable for what happened. As he puts it, poignantly: “We’re heartbroken. To have a mentally ill person shot in his own home? It’s terrible” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>It has been reported by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the unit that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, that police officers also used a taser on the victim.</p>
<p>Police across Canada kill numerous people experiencing mental health issues every. Cops should not be responding to people in mental health crisis and resources should be moved from police to mental health and health care supports and resources.</p>

0526-V1,"Lucien Silverquill was the primary caregiver for his 80-year-old mother. He encountered two police officers as they responded to a disturbance call involving a man with a knife. Shortly after they arrived, at least one of the officers fired a weapon, according to police. Silverquill was still alive when his brother arrived on scene. He said officers continued to try and subdue Silverquill, who had been shot in the chest and leg. A police report states that officers then performed first aid on Silverquill, but his brother says they did not. Medics pronounced Silverquill dead at the scene.
<p>Lucien Silverquill has been identified publicly by his brother Moses Silverquill as the 37-year-old Saulteaux man shot and killed by Saskatchewan RCMP. The victim was a father with young children. The scene he describes, and the RCMP handling of it, raises some serious questions about police conduct.</p>
<p>Moses Silverquill suggests that the RCMP, as is often the case when they kill someone, were more concerned with an arrest than with ensuring the victim received necessary medical attention. He reports that Lucien Silverquill was shot twice, once in the chest and once in the leg. He says his brother was alive for some time but in great pain.</p>
<p>According to Moses Siverquill, RCMP officers attempted to handcuff and subdue his brother after they had shot him. In his view more than half an hour passed before Lucien Silverquill was put into the ambulance that had arrived on the scene (Pasiuk 2019). In his words: “It was a very horrific scene when we got there&#8230;.They didn’t give him CPR or anything like that. They just pinned him to the ground. That’s what we saw” (quoted in Pasiuk 2019).</p>
<p>Moses Silverquill also points out the lack of information and response to questions by RCMP. He says that RCMP refused to let family members near his injured brother. According to Moses Silverquill: “It was very hard to get answers from [RCMP] as to what was going on with my brother” (quoted in Pasiuk 2019).</p>
<p>He has many questions about police actions before, during, and after the shooting. He wonders why alternative approaches were not taken and why police acted so quickly to shoot and were so single minded in privileging arrest over medical care, which his brother clearly needed. He asks: “I know the police officer that did the shooting must be really emotionally disturbed but was it dealt with properly? That’s the question&#8230;. Could this guy’s life have been saved?” (quoted in Pasiuk 2019).</p>
<p>Moses Silverquill reflects on the brother taken from his family by police violence: “My brother was a good person&#8230;. He had kids. He left little kids. I know he was a caring guy when he was with his family” (quoted in Pasiuk 2019).</p>

Officers used a Taser and handcuffed Donnelly, after which he went into medical distress. He was transported to hospital, where he died the next day. An investigation is ongoing.
<p>A 38-year-old man, identified publicly as Clayton Donnelly, died within hours of being tased by RCMP during an arrest in Malakwa, British Columbia (near Sicamous in the Okanagan), on October 28, 2019.</p>
<p>Ron MacDonald of the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the unit that examines cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia, reports:</p>
<p>“There was a driver who had been involved with the police earlier in a couple of other attempts to stop they vehicle he was driving. There was an interaction between the individual and the police where there was a struggle between the police and the individual. During that struggle, the male went unconscious.”</p>
<p>The IIO reports that the victim went into medical distress during the arrest. He was taken to hospital in critical condition and later died there.</p>
<p>Clayton Donnelly’s step-mother Kelly Harrison took to social media to say that Donnelly struggled for years with his mental health. Incredibly she had to respond to police sycophants who blamed Donnelly for being killed.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post she addressed hateful comments posted online about Donnelly. She also pointed out the lack of support available to people suffering from mental health issues. In her words:</p>
<p>“For those who like to condemn and judge and leave nasty messages on Facebook, maybe think a bit how you feel if it was your own loved one.</p>
<p>“If I see one more comment, that he is a criminal and he deserved it I will scream. He is not a criminal he is a tortured soul, who was suffering from mental illness. This story is also about a wonderful family, that for over two years tried to get him help with success!”</p>

Several use-of-force options were used, though which techniques, besides the use of the Taser, are still unclear. Mensah was taken into custody but lost consciousness shortly afterward. He was taken to a local hospital and was later pronounced dead. The medical records show that he was Tasered approximately six times. A 2015 medical report reveals that Mensah had a history of mental illness.The investigation is ongoing, but the family wonders if Mensah's race played a part in his death. 
<p>Clive Mensah, a 30-year-old Black man, has been identified as the person killed by Peel Regional Police in Mississauga, Ontario, on November 20, 2019. Mr. Mensah’s family came forward publicly with this information on July 21, 2020, partly inspired by the growing attention to police killings of Black and Indigenous people in Canada and the Black Lives Matter movement. Those mobilizations have brought a focus on police killings of people experiencing mental health crises or as part of police &#8220;wellness checks&#8221; (which are not about wellness at all).</p>
<p>They report that since their loved one’s killing in 2019, they have heard almost nothing from investigators with the Special Investigations Unit (SIU). They are desperate for answers about why police killed their family member, who was unarmed and known to struggle with mental health issues.</p>
<p>Hospital records from the killing show that Mensah was “Tased approximately six times.” He was found lying on the ground and handcuffed by paramedics. The hospital report also records that paramedics faced a delay in reaching the victim because “police cruisers blocked roadway to scene.” Paramedics reportedly had to park between 15 to 18 meters away from where Mr. Mensah lay.</p>

<p>SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon reports: “As part of the struggle, several use-of-force options were used, including the deployment of a conducted energy weapon.” The man was taken into custody and soon after lost consciousness.

0579-V1,"Police were checking on Chantel Courtney Moore's well-being when they shot her at her home. A former boyfriend asked police to check on Moore after he received strange messages from her on Facebook. Police say that the officer arrived on the scene and was suddenly confronted by Moore, who was allegedly wielding a knife. Moore's family contests the police account of events. The officer then shot Moore multiple times, according to a family member. The incident was ""really quick,"" according to police. Moore died at the scene. An investigation is ongoing.
<p>Edmundston Police (New Brunswick) shot and killed Chantel Moore, a 26-year-old Indigenous woman of Tlaoquiaht First Nation, near Tofino, so-called British Columbia, during a so-called wellness check early in the morning of June 4, 2020. The family has reported that the victim was shot five times by police. Edmundston Police Force Inspector Steve Robinson told reporters that he did not believe that the officer in question attempted to use any non-lethal force. Chantel Moore was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Chantel Moore’s grandmother, Nora Martin, is certain the killing is racist in nature. In her words: “When I first heard about it, that was my first thought: ‘This was racially motivated.’ We’ve been dealing with police brutality for a number of years. I know in my own family it’s been going on for a long time” (quoted in CTV News 2020).</p>
<p>The history of policing in Canada is one of racism and white supremacy at its core. Policing has played a central part in the dispossession, displacement, subjugation, control, killing, and genocide of Indigenous people and communities—has been central to the interlinking settler colonial capitalist projects. And policing continues to play a key part in maintaining those projects up to the present.</p>
<p>This is yet another, too common, case of police being the first sent out when people are believed to be in crisis or in need of a “wellness check.” Police should not be sent under these circumstances. They are not health care providers. Too often the outcome is police killing the person needing support or care. Police are not about wellness. Resources for health care, including mental health care, should be diverted away from police and used in community health care supports. Police budgets continue to grow as necessary health care services require more funding.</p>
<p>Police will be investigating police in this killing. Officers from Saint John will be part of the investigation as well as an as yet unnamed “independent agency” (which will in no way be independent given the involvement of police in the investigation).</p>

RCMP say police were confronted by Levi, who was carrying knives. A Taser was used several times before an officer used a firearm. A friend said  Levi struggled with addiction but had been trying to remain sober. Metepenagiag First Nation Chief Bill Ward said in a Facebook video that he believes Levi was not going to hurt anyone. Indigenous leaders are calling for an Indigenous-led independent inquiry as they are concerned that Quebec's BEI may be biased in favour of police. The Levi family launched a GoFundMe campaign to start an independent inquiry. 
<p>People in the community report that New Brunswick RCMP have shot and killed Rodney Levi, a Mi’kmaq man, in Metepenagiag First Nation (also known as Red Bank First Nation) on June 12, 2020.

0565-V1,"Ejaz Ahmed Choudry, 62, was fatally shot by police during a wellness check. Choudry’s family says that he had schizophrenia and they called a non-emergency helpline. Paramedics who arrived on the scene called the police when they saw Choudry with a pocket knife. Bystander video shows three officers on his balcony yelling at him to put his knife down. They eventually fired five shots into his apartment. Police entered the apartment and reportedly fired more shots. The officers used several use-of-force methods, including a Taser and plastic projectiles. Choudry was ultimately shot. The family told CBC that Choudry didn't speak English, information they say they had shared with the police. An investigation is ongoing.
<p>Peel Region police shot and killed 62-year-old Ejaz Ahmed Choudry on Saturday, June 20, 2020. He was reportedly shot five times in the back. Mr. Choudry, a Muslim man, was experiencing mental health crisis and needed support and care, not police primed to shoot to kill. He was a husband and father of four, the youngest of whom is only seven.</p>
<p>According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, reports that police were called to an apartment unit at 3425 Morning Star Drive, near Goreway Drive, at around 5 PM, to “check on the well-being of a man.” Family members have since said that Mr. Choudry suffered from schizophrenia as well as other illnesses. He was alone in the unit and did not pose a threat to the public or others. Family members have described him as harmless.</p>
<p>For an older man in crisis alone in his room, posing no threat to others, police sent multiple officers and a canine unit. A video taken by a witness and posted on twitter, shows police tactical units putting climbing a ladder and breaking into Mr. Choudry’s second floor apartment from the balcony. Three officers are shown kicking open the door and shouting into the residence. One can imagine the awful impact this might have on someone said to be in crisis. Several gunshots can be heard before all three officers even enter the apartment, again raising issues of the shoot first approach by police officers. This is one reason that they should not be sent out on mental health related calls.</p>
<p>Incredibly, police have sought to explain killing Mr. Choudry by suggesting they were concerned about his safety. Peel Constable Sarah Patten claims: “The state of crisis that he was in and the belief that he had access to weapons, yes, we believe that he was a danger to himself” (quoted in CBC News 2020). Patten makes the absurd statement that officers broke into his apartment “to check on his well-being” (quoted in CBC News 2020).</p>
<p>According to the SIU, police claim that once police entered the apartment unit, “an interaction occurred which included officers deploying a conducted energy weapon at the man, as well as firing plastic projectiles from an Anti-Riot Weapon Enfield” (quoted in CBC News 2020). Again, we must ask why police were doing a supposed wellness check with anti-riot weapons?</p>
<p>The mentality of police is reflected in this statement by Peel Regional Police Constable Akhil Mooken, who said, tellingly: “Communication was initiated with the man to try to communicate a peaceful surrender” (quoted in Yuen 2020). Surrender. This is the language of war. For someone needing health care supports.<br />
Family Members Not Allowed to Help</p>
<p>Family members who were present say that Mr. Choudry had come to the door when other families had been removed from the unit but was frightened back in when he saw officers coming toward him. An entirely understandable response to seeing police coming at you.</p>
<p>Khizar Shahzad, a nephew, reports that he informed the supervising officer of the severity of his uncle’s condition and told the officer the man was frightened: “I said, ‘Hey, he’s scared of your uniform, he’s not scared of you’” (quoted in CBC News 2020). The family pleaded with police to allow them to speak with their loved one who did not speak English. Police refusal to allow this is common in cases where police have been called about someone in mental health distress. Family who know the person and how best to interact with them are removed and kept from participating. This often plays a part in deadly police actions.</p>
<p>Muhammed Choudry, also a nephew, implored police: “Let me go upstairs, let my dad go upstairs, let my brother go upstairs. Because we’ve done this before where he listens. He listens to us” (quoted in CBC News 2020).</p>
<p>Family members say Mr. Choudry had difficulty breathing and walking. Mr. Choudry died at the scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demands for Review and Inquiry</p>
<p>The Muslim Council of Peel has called for an immediate review of police use of force, particularly during mental-health calls. They also want publicly available race-based demographic data on police shootings. As they note in a media release:</p>
<p>“A disproportionate number of racialized individuals including Black, Indigenous and Muslim are the victims of police shootings across Canada and right here in Peel Region” (quoted in CBC News 2020).</p>
<p>The council and family are demanding an independent public inquiry into the police killing of Ejaz Choudry. In their words:</p>
<p>“Given the video evidence and the testimony of family members, Peel police’s conduct in this matter was clearly excessive and requires nothing short of an independent inquiry unconnected to the SIU” (quoted in CBC News 2020).</p>
<p>Police are heard in the video shouting at Mr. Choudry to put a gun down. No gun was retrieved at the scene.</p>
<p>The SIU has assigned six investigators and three forensic investigators to examine the police killing of Ejaz Choudry.</p>

<p>An inquest into the killing of Naverone Woods has begun in Burnaby, British Columbia on March 20, 2017. Woods, a 23-year-old Gitxsan man, was shot and killed by a Metro Vancouver Transit Police officer in Surrey, British Columbia in December 2014. This case has generated much concern and organized protest but few answers for grieving family members. The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), which investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, earlier reported that Woods was shirtless and suffering from self-inflicted knife wounds when police, including the transit police officer, encountered him inside a Safeway grocery store in the Whalley neighborhood in Surrey. The transit officer then fired her gun striking and killing Woods. She was cleared by the IIO in may 2016. The Metro Vancouver Transit Police are the first armed transit force in Canada.</p>
<p>The inquest, heard by presiding coroner Brynne Redford and a jury, has no power to attribute wrongdoing or recommend charges. They will examine evidence around the killing of Woods and make recommendations that they have no mechanism to enforce on police.</p>
<p>Family and friends have consistently referred to Naverone Woods as gentle, caring, and helpful.</p>

<p>The BC Coroners Service has announced that it will hold a public inquest into the death of Naverone Christian Landon Woods, a young Gitxsan man shot and killed by police in Surrey, British Columbia in 2014. The killing of the 23-year-old Woods, of Hazelton, has generated much concern and some pubic outcry and protest but few answers or information (such as names of officers involved) despite an investigation by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) the (non-independent) provincial oversight body that examines cases of police killings of civilians in BC.</p>
<p>What has been reported is that Naverone Woods entered a Safeway grocery store in the Whalley area in north Surrey, near the Skytrain, around 8 AM on December 28, 2014. Customers and staff either at the grocery store or a nearby convenience store reportedly called 911. Two officers from the Metro Vancouver Transit Police, an armed transit force, the first of its kind in Canada, entered the store and in the ensuing encounter one officer shot and killed Woods. The victim was taken to Royal Columbia Hospital in New Westminster, BC where he died shortly upon arrival.</p>
<p>The inquest will be see evidence presented to presiding coroner Brynne Redford and a jury. Testimony will be taken from witnesses under oath. Members of the public can make presentations. The focus will be on establishing facts of the killing and making recommendations but these have no binding power or authority.</p>
<p>The inquest into the police killing of Naverone Woods is scheduled to begin on March 20, 2017 at 9:30 AM. It will be held at Burnaby Coroners Court, 20th floor, MetroTower II, Metrotown, 4720 Kingsway, Burnaby, BC.</p>

<p>A coroner’s inquest into the November 7, 2016, in-custody death of Ebony Aaron Wood (36) in Quesnel, British Columbia, began Tuesday, November 14, 2017. The BC Coroners Service reports that Wood was involved in a vehicular incident and was taken into custody and placed in a police cruiser on November 5, 2016. He apparently told an RCMP officer that he had chest and shoulder pain and an ambulance was called. Wood was transferred to the ambulance to be taken to hospital. At some point en route he exited the rear of the ambulance falling to the road and suffering a head injury. He dies two days later on November 7, 2016.</p>
<p>The inquest is mandatory because Wood was in the custody of a police officer at the time of his death. Regional coroner Donita Kuzma will be joined by a jury in hearing from witnesses in an attempt to establish the facts of Wood’s death. Coroners’ inquests do not assign fault in such deaths, and its recommendations need not be followed by any police force or officers.</p>

<p>Sheffield Matthews (41) has been identified by the Quebec coroner’s office as the Black man who was shot and killed by Montreal police officers in NDG on October 29, 2020.</p>



<p>As earlier reported here:</p>



<p>The killing took place in NDG (Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Borough, at about 6 AM, at the corner of Côte Saint-Luc Road and West Hill Avenue. The Bureau des enquetes independantes (Bureau of Independent Investigations, BEI), the agency that examines cases of police harm in Quebec, is investigating. The BEI reports that officers stayed in their vehicles and shot the man when he approached a vehicle with a knife. There has been no public explanation for why police felt threatened in their vehicle facing a man outside, even if he was holding a knife.</p>



<p>Montreal police have killed multiple Black men in NDG. On November 11, 1987, police killed Anthony Griffin outside of an NDG police station. Police shot and killed Nicholas Gibbs in NDG in 2018.</p>



<p>The BEI has assigned eight investigators to examine this killing. The BEI is not an independent force. They rely on police officers from other forces to do their investigations. They have also been widely criticized for having no racialized people among their investigators.</p>

<p>Quebec’s Independent Investigations Bureau (BEI), the unit that examines police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating the in custody death of David Tshiteya Kalubi, a 23-year-old Black youth. Kalubi, who was arrested by Montreal police in his own neighborhood of Hochelaga, was declared dead less that 12 hours after his arrest.</p>
<p>Little information has been released publicly. Police say Kalubi was stopped by officers in Hochelaga and arrested on an outstanding warrant after police ran a background check. The BEI has not stated publicly what the outstanding warrant was for, only that it involved a municipal offense.</p>
<p>Community activists in the city, which has seen many cases of lethal police violence against civilians, and disproportionately against Black people, are raising concerns about Kalubi’s death and the actions of police. Racial profiling and so-called carding, where people are stopped by police and subjected to interrogation and/or background checks, have been strongly condemned by community members in cities across Canada. Carding goes hand in hand with profiling as Black people are disproportionately stopped for carding checks in Canadian contexts. Kalubi is of Congolese background.</p>
<p>Montreal police reportedly took Kalubi to the station, where he spent the night before being transferred to the municipal courthouse in Old Montreal to appear before a judge, according to the BEI. The transfer took place at 7:35 AM. Only a little more than an hour later, at 8:55 AM, a guard noticed that Kalubi was on the floor and appeared to be unconscious. He was then taken to the hospital and declared dead at 9:55 AM. Community members are raising concerns that Kalubi was subjected to differential, discriminatory, treatment because of histories of police racism in Montreal. The family, for its part has not raised the issues of racial profiling. According to the family’s lawyer, Virginie Dufresne-Lemire: “For the moment, there’s not enough information to know if it’s a case of racial profiling, but with a young black man arrested it can look like racial profiling” (quoted in MacArthur 2017).</p>
<p>Dan Philip, the executive director of the Black Coalition of Quebec has said publicly that it took police seven hours to notify his mother and family of Kalubi’s death. Even then, police took the opportunity to  first interrogated the family about Kalubi, before telling them he was dead, according to Philip. Said Philip, in an interview with CBC News: “They felt it was a travesty. They felt there was no compassion. They felt that there was no concern about either the death of the young man or the family themselves who have to mourn the situation” (quoted in MacArthur 2017).</p>
<p>Community advocates have little confidence that the BEI will provide satisfactory answers to the family’s many questions. Critics have long pointed out that the BEI includes several former police officers among its active members.  As Philips suggests: “It’s the police investigating the police. They have no interest in finding out why did he died and what negligence caused his death” (quoted in MacArthur 2017). It has also been pointed out repeatedly that the BEI lacks any meaningful diversity. It is expected that their report will not be released for another year yet.</p>

<p>François Laurin, an officer of the provincial Sûreté du Québec, has been sentenced to one year in jail for dangerous driving causing death, eight months to be served concurrently for dangerous driving causing bodily harm, and two years of probation in the vehicular killing of Éric Rompré and injuring of Marie-Ève Bossé in June 2012. Laurin had been found guilty of these offenses in January 2017. As part of his sentence, Laurin will also have to serve 150 hours of community service. He is prohibited from driving for 30 months.</p>
<p>Officer Laurin collided with a car carrying Éric Rompré and his partner Marie-Ève Bossé while racing to support a fellow officer at the Montebello Rockfest. He was traveling at 180 km/hr at the time. Rompré (25) died as a result of the crash, while Bossé is still suffering from the serious injuries that she sustained, including head trauma.</p>
<p>The Crown prosecutor had called for a two-year sentence for dangerous driving causing death, 16 months to be served concurrently for dangerous driving causing bodily harm, and a four-year driving ban. Laurin, a 28-year veteran of the force has been suspended without pay by the Sûreté du Québec.</p>

<p>The state protects the state. Killer cops are rarely charged in Canada. And when they are, they are typically acquitted, even in cases in which they have obviously acted in a dubious, reckless, or murderous manner.</p>
<p>Quebec City police officer Simon Beaulieu backed his police car over Guy Blouin on September 3, 2014, killing the 48-year-old. Beaulieu used this lethal force against Blouin for no other reason than a baseless suspicion that Blouin had stolen a bike. This was apparently a case of class-based police profiling of a working class person in a working class neighborhood. Blouin had, in fact purchased his bike. Officer Beaulieu was charged in October 2015 of criminal negligence and dangerous driving causing death after he struck and killed Blouin.</p>
<p>On Friday, January 12, 2018, killer cops Beaulieu was found not guilty on both counts by Quebec Court Judge René de la Sablonnière. A not surprising result, no matter how unjust.</p>
<p>De la Sablonnière said the elements of proof presented to him did not show without a reasonable doubt that Beaulieu&#8217;s actions that day were dangerous, despite the fact that he sped backwards the wrong way on a one way street and drove over a cyclist who had, in fact done nothing wrong and posed no threat to the public or the officer. The judge concluded: “This was a sad and unfortunate accident” (quoted in Page 2018). But actively driving backwards over someone on a bike is not an “accident.”</p>
<p>The judge reached his conclusion despite the fact that the Crown prosecutor&#8217;s expert witness was a Sûreté du Québec crime reconstruction expert (another cop) who testified the police cruiser was going 44 kilometers per hour when it struck Blouin. The judge simply decided to side with the defense version of events which posed the police cruiser’s speed at 22 kilometers per hour. Why side with defense (posing a self-interested estimate) against one provided by a police expert (usually believed unquestioningly in cases against civilians)? The answer is that the state is always predisposed to protect the state in cases of police harm to civilians, under even the most egregious circumstances.</p>
<p>Incredibly, De la Sablonnière said Beaulieu made sure the coast was clear before backing up. This despite that obvious case that it was not clear—as evidenced by the fact that <em>he ran Blouin over</em>. How could he have ensured the coast was clear? Then the judge blamed faulty ABS brakes, a scenario only raised by a defense promoted and provided witness. Said de la Sablonnière: “He could not foresee there was a problem with the brakes” (quoted in Page 2018). But why was he speeding backward toward someone on a bicycle anyway? That is the question.</p>
<p>Throughout his ruling De la Sablonnière repeated that in order for a person to be found guilty of criminal negligence, his actions had to be significantly out of step with what is considered to be normal behavior. But he made sure to stress that normal or expected behavior had to be considered differently for police officers than for civilians (see the contradiction there—normal defined as different for some).</p>
<p>Stuart Edwards, a member of a citizens&#8217; committee from the working class Saint-Roch neighborhood where the accident happened, pointed out that the reasoning behind the ruling is hard to accept (Page 2018). And clearly it is for anyone not ready to accept class-profiling of poor ad working class people or to treat police in a privileged manner within a legal system that otherwise brags of “equality before the law” (yes, we know that is a myth).</p>
<p>Said Edwards, from the committee formed in response to Blouin’s killing and who was present in court at each step in the trial: “That’s a judicial impunity for a policeman, because he’s a policeman. I don&#8217;t buy that. I’m personally disappointed. I don’t accept this — I think it’s wrong” (quoted in Page 2018).</p>
<p>As should we all. And Edwards noted that the committee is very much concerned with the effect the not guilty ruling will have in the community. It validates the exertion of lethal force by police against people in a poor and working class community under any circumstances and  with impunity.</p>
<p>The city’s “police brotherhood” confirmed that concern saying the court decision recognizes that society must give special consideration to police officers. That sounds a lot like a threat.</p>

<p>Page, Julia. 2018. “Quebec City Police Officer Acquitted of All Charges in 2014 Death of Cyclist.” <em>CBC News</em> January 12. <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/verdict-police-officer-guy-blouin-trial-1.4483566"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/verdict-police-officer-guy-blouin-trial-1.4483566</a></p>

<p>Québec City police officer Simon Beaulieu killed 48-year-old Guy Blouin on September 3, 2014, striking the victim with his vehicle. Guy Blouin died in hospital from the fatal chest injuries inflicted by Beaulieu.</p>
<p>On October 13, 2017 the first witness testified in Beaulieu’s trial with the officer facing charges of criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death. Yves Brière, a crime scene reconstruction expert with the Sûreté du Québec, the provincial police force, testified that Beaulieu’s police cruiser hit and killed Guy Blouin while backing up on a one-way street at 44 kilometers an hour.</p>
<p>Brière showed Québec Court Judge René de la Sablonnière photos of the police cruiser, and explained that Blouin and the bicycle slid under the car, at the corner of Saint-François Est and du Parvis streets, in the Saint-Roch neighborhood. Blouin was run over with the right rear wheel of the cruiser. Brière testified that by the time the police car driven by Beaulieu had stopped, Blouin’s body was lying seven meters away. The police car’s bumper showed several rubber marks where the bicycle slid under the car, according to Brière.</p>
<p>Incredibly officer Beaulieu was promoted from constable to sergeant-detective <em>after</em> driving over and killing Guy Boulin. And people wonder why the public might be skeptical about prospects for police accountability within a system that depends on and rewards killer cops. Killer cop Beaulieu has been on desk duty pending his trial.</p>

<p>It is rare for police officers in Canada who kill to face any repercussions. It is almost unheard of for them to be charged. It almost never occurs in cases involving the police killing of poor or street involved people. In one of the rare instances officer Simon Beaulieu of the Québec City police will stand trial for driving over cyclist Guy Blouin with a police cruiser in 2014</p>
<p>Beaulieu drove his police car at 48-year-old Blouin in an attempt to intercept him for nothing more than driving his bike the wrong way on a one way street. Driving a bike on the wrong side of the road or on the sidewalk are occurrences that happen regularly in cities across the country every day. Witnesses report the police cruiser was backed up over the stricken cyclist who died several hours later in hospital.</p>
<p>Beaulieu will face a trial by Québec court judge on charges of criminal negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death. Beaulieu’s lawyer had sought a trial by jury. Lawyers for police often do so hoping to screen in favor of jurors who are sympathetic to police. In cases where the victim is poor or street involved it is less likely their peers will be part of any jury pool.</p>
<p>Residents in the St.-Roch neighborhood where Blouin was killed formed a group, Comité 3 septembre in response to Blouin’s killing. One member, street nurse Sandy McKay, believes that Blouin was a victim of police profiling as a member of the low-income, marginalized community of St.-Roch. The killing would thus be a case of police initiated poor bashing (a not uncommon experience of police activity in poor neighborhoods). The group is glad that this case will make it to trial. They state that members of the community, especially those who are street involved, remain traumatized and fearful by the killing of Guy Blouin by police officer Simon Beaulieu.</p>

<p>The Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), the unit that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Quebec is investigating the in-custody death of 24-year-old father of two Brandon Stephens in a jail cell in the Cree community of Waskaganish. The community is 1055 kilometers northwest of Montreal on the shores of James Bay.</p>
<p>A statement released by the Eeyou Eenou Police claims officers were called to a residence in the community at around 1 PM on Monday, January 1, 2018. They say they found a man identified as Brandon Stephen intoxicated and threatening to harm himself. Police report  he was then taken into custody.</p>
<p>According to police, at around 11 PM Stephen informed guards that he was not feeling well. At some point he was transferred to the medical clinic in the community where he died at around 3 AM on January 2.</p>
<p>This is the second police-involved death in an Indigenous community in northern Quebec, in a period of a week.</p>

<p>On November 7, 2017, Rodrigo Hector Almonacid Gonzalez, a hospital worker and father of two young sons, died from injuries sustained in an interaction with Toronto police. Less than a day before more than ten Toronto Police officers, including a tactical squad equipped with a battering ram and shields, had forced their way into the Gonzalez home where the 43 year old occupant had apparently locked himself in his bathroom for reasons yet unknown. During the police encounter two Tasers were deployed against Gonzalez and he was taken from the building on a stretcher.</p>
<p>Photographs taken by Gonzalez’s wife at the hospital reveal horrific injuries including a bloody head injury, a black eye, bruising on an arm and shoulder, and what the family believes to be a Taser mark near the victim’s groin. The family was notified that Gonzalez had internal bleeding shortly before he succumbed to his injuries. His mother and wife reported than he had no injuries before police arrived. They also reported being kept from entering the apartment by police officers.</p>
<p>Disturbingly, despite the injuries sustained by the victim in his encounter with police and despite his death in hospital the next day, the province’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), tasked with investigating all such incidents of police involved civilian harm, took five days before showing up at the apartment to investigate. The family was not told to preserve the scene in the bathroom where the encounter is believed to have occurred and it is not clear if essential evidence has been lost as a result. SIU should have attended and secured the scene directly once it was reported.</p>
<p>Toronto police have refused to comment on the case but an SIU spokesperson confirmed that police reported the incident the day it happened and notified the SIU when Gonzalez died the next day. No answer has been given by SIU for why it took their investigators four days to contact the family. Three SIU investigators and one forensic investigator have since been assigned to the case.</p>

<p>The woman killed by Toronto police on January 2, 2017 has been identified as Amleset Haile. The 60 year-old native of Ethiopia was living at a home on St. Clarens Avenue, a Houselink home for people with mental health and addiction issues, when police killed her. Amleset Haile’s name has only been released publicly now. While the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency responsible for investigating cases of civilians harmed by police in Ontario, is investigating the killing it has not released her name.</p>
<p>Police arrived at the home near Bloor and Lansdowne Streets in west Toronto at 4:45 AM on January 2 in response to a report of an emotionally distraught woman threatening suicide. Only 15 minutes later, about 5 AM, Amleset Haile was wheeled out on a stretcher, not moving, her neck held in a brace. The woman would die two  days later in hospital after being taken off of life support.</p>
<p>Many questions remain unanswered in the month following her death at the hands of police. And family, friends, and neighbors want answers. Among the questions are why a home for people with mental health issues sis not have trained staff available to assist a distraught woman. Another question concerns why such a home would call police first rather than health care providers. Other questions involve what exactly police did to the woman and why and how did she sustain severe trauma to her body within 15 minutes of police activity. The SIU has not confirmed any police claims about the incident.</p>
<p>Friend Jennifer Cox witnessed part of the incident and believes Haile was in fear and running from police. She does not believe the frail woman was strong enough to lift herself up to jump from a window or balcony. Cox, like others, wonders if the situation involving her friend could have ended differently had a mental health caregiver  been called and responded instead of police.</p>
<p>The Toronto Police Department does have Mobile Crisis Intervention Teams (MCIT), roving units made up of a specially trained police officer and a mental-health nurse. Despite repeated recommendations and calls coming from coroner’s inquests these crisis teams are not available 24-hours a day. And none are available between 11 PM and 6 AM, what can be desperate overnight hours.</p>
<p>In the view of Steve Lurie, executive director of the Toronto branch of the Canadian Mental Health Association, there should be an expansion of hours of specialized mental health units. As he puts it: “If the call was ‘we think someone is suicidal,’ it makes more sense to bring mental health professionals to bear if they are available” (quoted in Gillis 2017).</p>
<p>On the whole far more resources should be put into independent mental health sources and resources in cities across Canada. Yet public funding is overwhelmingly given to police departments, at the expense of mental health care, harm reduction, support services, health care services for poor people, etc. Police departments continue to  make up the greatest part of city budgets while mental health funding and resources are slashed.</p>
<p>Amleset Haile is remembered by friends and the community organizations she was active in as generous, caring, and kind. She contributed to her communities through groups like Houselink and Sistering, a group for homeless and poor women in Toronto.</p>

<p>Anthony Aust, a 23-year-old Black man, fell to his death from a twelfth-floor apartment after Ottawa police used a so-called dynamic entry, a tactic identified by courts as showing disregard for Charter rights. Police used the dynamic entry while executing a drug raid, according to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians, in the morning of October 7, 2020.</p>



<p>It has not been reported publicly what happened after police entered the apartment, what police did, or how long they were there before the victim fell. It has been reported that other people were present inside the apartment at the time of the raid, including younger siblings, mother, grandmother, and stepfather, but not whether they sustained any injuries.</p>



<p>Dynamic entries are akin to the infamous “no knock” raids familiar  in the United States. Masked officers break into a building, often deploying “distraction devices,” such as flash grenades, with guns drawn. While legally required to knock and announce their presence as police, this is not always done (Yogaretnam 2020)</p>



<p>On February 11, 2020, Superior Court Justice Sally Gomery ruled, with reference to another drug raid case, that police use of dynamic entry is “serious misconduct” (Yogaretnam 2020). In her decision she concluded:</p>



<p>“The knock-and-announce principle has been part of Canadian law for decades. The officers who testified did not say when the Ottawa police decided that dynamic entry should be the rule rather than the exception. However long the practice has been in place, it reflects a casual disregard for charter rights.” (quoted in Yogaretnam 2020)</p>



<p>She denied blanket justifications for the use of dynamic entry based on police claims of “officer safety.” In her words:</p>



<p>“This does not justify systemic use of dynamic entry to execute all, or almost all, search warrants of private dwellings in Ottawa. The police cannot operate from an assumption that they should break in the door of any residence that they have a warrant to search. The court must be concerned about disassociating itself from this practice.” (quoted in Yogaretnam 20200</p>



<p>Police have since said that regardless of this finding they will continue to use the practices and clearly have done so.</p>



<p>While few details related to the death have been released publicly, this seems to be another fatality in the statist war on drugs. Decriminalization is essential, not still more police violence.</p>



<p>Three investigators and one forensic investigator have been assigned to the case by the SIU.</p>

<p>On September 4, 1995, several members of the Stony Point nation entered Ipperwash Provincial Park, located on the eastern shore of Lake Huron in the area called, in statist terms, southwestern Ontario, with the intention of reclaiming their community’s land and a traditional burial ground. Within 72 hours of the indigenous community occupation at Ipperwash Provincial Park, one of the community’s members, Anthony O’Brien (Dudley) George was dead. He had been shot and killed by an officer of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), Kenneth “Tex” Deane, who had fired multiple rounds from an assault weapon at the non-threatening and unarmed George.</p>
<p>After the shooting of Dudley George many questions began to be asked. What role did the Ontario government play in pushing the OPP to move on the occupiers? Why did the OPP decide to march on the occupiers, taking an aggressive and confrontational approach (a full frontal assault) when there were already plans developed to address the situation through less aggressive means? Why were the OPP armed so heavily and with assault with assault weapons when it was known through a CSIS (Canadian Security and Intelligence Services) mole that the occupiers were unarmed?</p>
<p>Some partial answers to these questions would only come out in the criminal trial of Tex Deane and the public inquiry held a decade after George’s homicide by police. The shooting of Dudley George came a day after newly elected Premier of Ontario, Mike Harris ordered OPP to “get the fucking Indians out of Ipperwash Park” (Ipperwash Inquiry 2007). An aide in the Premier’s office notoriously proclaimed: “The government will not be seen as cooperating with the Indians.” This was only a day before Dudley George was shot and killed. Yet the deeper answers to these questions are rooted in the general history of colonialism and genocide in Canada and the specific harms inflicted on The Kettle Point and Stony Point communities.</p>
<p>At the heart of policing across the Canadian context is, as it always is in the case of settler colonialism, control of land, Indigenous land. In the Canadian state context policing has always been a military exercise in the service of displacement, dispossession, seizure, securing, and settling of land and, where deemed necessary, re-seizing and re-securing land in those cases where Indigenous communities have organized to reclaim their community lands. The examples in Canadian history are numerous and ongoing. A litany of state organized and state enacted theft. Nothing less. Organized crime at the highest level. The names of incidents of state violence in the seizure of Indigenous lands live in infamy. So too the cases of police assaults carried out in the re-taking of land re-claimed by Indigenous communities. Oka, Gustafsen Lake, Sun Peaks, Caledonia, to name only a few recent ones. And Ipperwash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Ongoing History of Colonial Crimes: Always an Ipperwash Crisis for Indigenous People</p>
<p>The great Shawnee war chief Tecumseh, whose relations moved to Kettle Point, received a lecture from his older brother Chiksika. He said:</p>
<p>“When a white man kills an Indian in a fair fight it is called honorable, but when an Indian kills a white man in a fair fight it is called murder&#8230; When an Indian is killed it is a great loss which leaves a gap in our people and a sorrow in our heart; when a white is killed, three or four others step up to take his place and there is no end to it. The white man seeks to conquer nature, to bend it to his will and use it wastefully&#8230;The whole white race is a monster who is always hungry and what he eats is land.” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 33)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story of the OPP Ipperwash police assault and the killing of Dudley George is rooted in a historic theft of land by the Canadian government for purposes of war. On July 10, 1827, Chief Wawanosh would conclude a treaty that would see King George IV acquire around 2,200,000 acres of prime land in Southwestern Ontario. The treaty would see the establishment of the Kettle and Stony Point reserves with a measly 5000 acres combined. The treaty conference that gave rise to the Kettle and Stony Point reserves came from a concern over land squatting (theft) by white settlers. In return the Indigenous communities received a promise that the Crown would provide living payments “annually and forever” (Edwards 2001, 39). Yet the Crown came to this agreement clearly intending that forever would be a very short time, if the Indigenous population decreased and, indeed, disappeared. The genocidal intentions, or at least expectations, of government, settlers, and missionaries were not hidden beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Primitive accumulation in the Canadian context occurred according to a brutal explicit calculus. This was made clear in crude terms by Reverend Thomas Hurlburt, Methodist missionary to Kettle and Stony Point and the city of Sarnia. In 1864 Reverend Hurlburt wrote in a piece in the <em>Lambton County Gazeteer and Genneral Business Directory</em> to lay out the mathematics of genocide for the general public. He stated:</p>
<p>“This is the easiest and cheapest way to dispose of the Indians of North America; for they must be disposed of in one of three ways; killed in war or by drink or Christianized by missionaries and thus made useful members of society&#8230;</p>
<p>“Having been in the mission among the Indians for the past 35 years, and having lived and labored among them in that capacity, I am acquainted with most of the tribes from Texas to the Hudson’s Bay territory, as well as in Canada, I have taken pains to gather the statistics of various Indian wars—the Florida, Black Hawks and others, and I find it requires $25,000 to dispose of an Indian by war, in addition to one white man being killed for every Indian. To dispose of them by drink I found by the statistics of those tribes who had large annuities, and consequently drunk much, that it required about $2,000 to kill an Indian by whiskey&#8230;</p>
<p>“In taking the statistics of our own Indian missions, I find it requires about $200 to Cristianize and civilize an Indian, and train him twenty years and thus give him a chance for both his life and that which is to come. Thus it is seen that it requires as much to kill an Indian in war as would Christianize 125, and train them twenty years. It requires as much to kill an Indian by whiskey as would Christianize and save ten. There are 125,000 Indians in British North America.” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 41)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the market calculus, the marketization of genocide. It is the logic that would give rise to the horrors of the residential schools and cultural erasure. This is the ongoing logic of colonialism that would find expression, sometimes explicit, in the Ipperwash crisis. It has economic, political, and cultural aspects.</p>
<p>A letter sent by agent A. Dingman of Strathroy to Prime Minister John A. Macdonald on August 27, 1884 and marked “Confidential” told a story of systematic theft of the resources of the reserve lands. In the letter Dingman recorded the activities of a timber mill owner A.L. Smith who operated in the area. The mill had been set up by the capitalist to ensure cloaked thievery. Noting that white settlers had stripped non-reserve lands of resources, Dingman reports:</p>
<p>“and there is now absolutely no place from which it is practicable to get logs with which to stock the mill except they come off the Indian Reserves. It is situated in such an out-of-the-way place that any person so disposed could easily get logs off the Reserves and few people would be aware of the fact unless they were specially interested in finding it out&#8230;.If the object was to plunder the Reserves of timber no better place could be found than the spot where the mill is situated.” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 42)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As was common across the area of Ontario, the capitalist represented himself as an agent of the government. Smith had even constructed a phony title for himself, “forest bailiff,” a position that did not actually exist in Ontario. In a scheme that brought together the recent push to Christianize the communities the capitalist concocted a deal to return some sawed boards to the community for sue in building a church the newly converted now wanted. As Dingman reported: “never a board was used on the church. This process was repeated time and time again until fully $5,000 worth of timber was cut and sawed into timber, but not one board went towards building the church” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 42). Still the cutting for profit brought the woods to the point of being barren of trees.</p>
<p>Dingman suggested that the trees at Stony Point might not survive another winter of plunder (Edwards 2001, 42). While settlers for miles around had fences for their farms, the Native farmers had no wood for their own fences (Edwards 2001, 43).</p>
<p>There were no charges brought by the Government of Canada against any of the settlers or capitalists who had stolen from the Indigenous communities. Nor was anyone held responsible for government corruption or incompetence (Edwards 2001, 43). The government of Prime Minister Macdonald protected capitalist interests in Treaty 242 of 1888 which gave the federal government permission to sell Native timber rights in exchange for minimal cooperation. Notably the failure of the government to meet wartime promises to provide compensation for wartime service in the War of 1812 persisted throughout the community. Similar struggles would play out over service in subsequent wars up through the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In 1927 a group of land speculators with connections in Ottawa turned their greedy eyes to reserve lands on the shores of Lake Huron. Band members were offered bribes of five dollars if they voted to surrender the lands to developers. An additional ten dollars was offered if the vote to surrender the lands was approved by council (Edwards 2001, 45). Despite the fact that the lands were located at Kettle Point, the vote (and the bribes) were offered to men of both bands. In the end the 33 acres of parkland were purchased by speculators for eighty-five dollars per acre. Half was resold immediately by the developers who had a pre-existing deal for three hundred dollars and acre. The Kettle Point band received $7706.20 for land that developers received $13,200 in selling only half.</p>
<p>Years later the Indian Claims Commission ruled that the federal government had cheated the community as government Indian agents abandoned the duty to protect by looking away as the deal went down. By that point cottagers had held the land for generations (Edwards 2001, 46).</p>
<p>In 1936 the Stoney Point community were deprived of more of their land, when the Province of Ontario purchased 108 acres of land that had been sold the previous year to private actors (Edwards 2001, 46). The land would be used for none other than Ipperwash Provincial Park.</p>
<p>When workers preparing the park uncovered evidence of a Native burial ground appeals were made to government by band council to fence that area off from development. Despite official letters from provincial and federal governments approving of this request the fence was never built. The area would become a picnic grounds complete with horseshoe pits (Edwards 2001, 46).</p>
<p>The history of land theft by capital, settlers, and government against the Kettle Point and Stony Point communities would continue as war loomed in Europe in the late 1930s. The Canadian government desired a military training ground in Ontario (centrally located in the province with the country’s largest population). Businesses desired a facility in the area sine they could profit greatly servicing and supplying the base. Local businesses saw dollar signs in providing the base with fruit, vegetables, grains, bread, oil, canned goods, garbage removal, etc. as had been the  case with a base at Pinehill Camp (Edwards 2001, 46-47). That base was closed due to lack of running water on site, a great loss for profit seeking local capital. Stoney Point provided an ideal site right on the shores of Lake Huron and with water running all through it (Edwards 2001, 47).</p>
<p>In addition to its beneficial geographical qualities, Stoney Point offered a political benefit in that the Natives of Stoney Point did not have the vote and could not punish the government or local representatives at the voting booth. Another benefit for the government was financial. The Department of National Defence appraised the Stoney Point lands in 1942 at fifteen dollars per acre, which was much less than market value for nearby non-reserve lands. Economically, Native lands were viewed as “non-productive” (as long as Natives held them) despite the fact that they were directly farmed for food and essential for community purposes. The notion that Indigenous held lands were non-productive is one that returned to the center of federal government ideology under the Conservative Party regime of Stephen Harper in the 2000s as his government sought to convert Indigenous lands to marketable properties.</p>
<p>While the land deal would be put to a vote of the Stoney Point community a letter from the Secretary of Indian Affairs was sent to the local Indian agent stating that the government was “prepared to use the War Measures Act if the  Indians refused a surrender” (Edwards 2001, 47). Some vote then. Some democracy. Appropriately, on April Fools’ Day 1942 the Stoney Point band voted on the  fate of the lands. Members fighting overseas would not even get a vote. Under the government plan they would turn over the full 2211 acres of their land, all houses, and farms for a sum of $50,000.</p>
<p>Indigenous community members suggested a counter-proposal to lease the land to the federal government for the duration of the war but Ottawa rejected this. And why not? They had an ace up their sleeve. The vote showed a rejection of the government plan with the proposal being defeated 59-13 (Edwards 2001, 48). Never mind the “democratic” result. The government turned to their back up plan. On April 14, 1942, the federal government passed an order-in-council effecting an appropriation of the <em>entire</em> Stoney Point reserve.</p>
<p>Despite concerns among the federal Department of Justice about the legality of taking lands against the stated will of the community, the War Measures Act took the houses and land of the people of Stoney Point in the same manner as would also be imposed on supposed “enemy aliens” such as Japanese civilians (Edwards 2001, 48). Eighteen Stoney Point families were removed from their homes and lands and transferred to the Kettle Point reserve. They were merged into one band and reduced to one federally recognized chief. The Department of Indian Affairs which was supposed to look out for the interests of Indigenous communities (but rarely if ever did) raised not an eyebrow. In fact they viewed the move as a punitive measure to better oversee and regulate the people once they were in a closer space. One Indian agent even reported the dispossession and displacement as a great opportunity to round up a “few straggling Indians” (Edwards 2001, 49). To add insult to injury the government changed the name of the band from Stoney Point to Stony Point for unclear, bureaucratic, reasons. Their former land became Canadian Forces Base at Ipperwash (CFB Ipperwash).</p>
<p>Notably such a move for land expropriation would never have been considered against local white farmers or business property owners. Yet the area around the Stoney Point lands were being developed for less than essential purposes such as tourist resorts and weekend getaways for white visitors from the cities and from the United States. Those lands could have been appropriated with less impact on an existing community. The racist perspective of colonialism would not allow for consideration of such a move.</p>
<p>Residents of Stoney Point were moved without notification or even time to pack. As one displaced member Pearl George related: “When we came home, our house was up on jacks and our two log cabins were gone. They didn’t tell us anything&#8230;They never even let u know they were coming so we could pack up the little things. A lot of things were broken. They moved us to Kettle Point, to a swamp” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 49). Three of her children born at Kettle Point would die after developing intestinal problems that she attributed to the swamp[ water. The displaced felt like strangers in another land. As Maynard George, a son of Pearl, would state: It was sort of like in Bosnia where they put two different ethnic groups together. They did not allocate us good wood or housing. We could not become members of the band council or get any work on the reserve” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 50). This made no difference to government and likely never even registered at all. Other homes were simply levelled rather than moved. This was the fate suffered by the small church at Stoney Point as well as by many of the headstones in a nearby cemetery.</p>
<p>One can try to imagine the feelings of soldiers such as Clifford George who returned to a levelled land after having risked his life fighting in Europe (for the very state that was stealing and bulldozing his home while he faced enemy fire). He would  later reflect: “I came home to nothing. I’ll never forget the feeling I had when I first went there [to Stoney Point] and couldn’t find my mother’s grave. They had removed the headstones and there were bullet holes and trenches dug. They could only do that to an Indian. That would never happen to white people” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 52). With no home to return to George would move to a nearby town. He would be stripped of his legal Indian status. In his words: “I came back to find the real enemy was here” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 53).</p>
<p>The Canadian government had promised the Stony Point community that their lands would be returned to them at cessation of the fighting at war’s end. Following the end of World War Two the Transitional Powers Act replaced the War Measures Act setting the stage for a social transition to post-war conditions.</p>
<p>On May 31, 1946, the advanced infantry training center at CFB Ipperwash was closed. The Department of National Affairs and Department of Indian Affairs opened discussions about returning the confiscated lands to the Indigenous community. On December 31, 1946, the Transitional Powers Act expired and the stolen lands had still not been returned. Yet no extension was granted for the Department of National Defense to retain the Stony Point lands. The government had no legal basis to keep the lands. But it did.</p>
<p>In this context life went on. And grew. Dudley George was born on March 17, 1957 at Sarnia General Hospital. Anthony O’Brien George was the eighth of ten children in a family that lived at the Sarnia reserve after his family’s community was destroyed by the Canadian government 15 years before Dudley was born. Ironically he got his nickname Dudley after the character Dudley Do-Right a clueless Mountie featured in Saturday morning cartoons (Edwards 2001, 55). His family would move to Kettle Point when he was eight.</p>
<p>The efforts by Stony Point members to reclaim their land did not cease at any point during the period in which their lands were controlled by the Canadian government. Future Prime Minister Jean Chretien, then Minister of Indian Affairs noted in a letter to the Minister of National Defense in 1972:</p>
<p>“Since 1946 our respective Departments have been corresponding on the subject of the return of some 2,200 acres comprising Canadian Forces Base Camp Ipperwash which was appropriated in 1942 by the Department of National Defence under the War Measures Act&#8230;.</p>
<p>“The Chippewas of Kettle Point have repeatedly requested the return of these lands which are needed to enable the Band to improve its economic and social position. Time has not altered the Indians’ view that they were wronged by the forcible taking of their reserve in 1942. Moreover, it was their understanding that the land was to have been returned to them at the end of hostilities.</p>
<p>“With cuts in the Canadian Forces Bases indicated it seems to me that this is an appropriate time to reconsider this matter and I would appreciate having advice as to your Department’s plans for Camp Ipperwash. The transfer of this land to the administration and control of this Department so that it could be returned to reserve status would be of great importance to the Kettle Point Indians and would remove a major source of dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Federal Government have dealt with this reserve.” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 58)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing came of this of course. Of note, Chretien had become Prime Minister of Canada at the time the Ipperwash reclamation occupation, and shooting of Dudley George, occurred. Yet he did nothing as Prime Minister to improve a situation of injustice that he was clearly aware needed to be redressed and had be aware of for decades.</p>
<p>In 1950 the park superintendent’s wife had reported the discovery of human bones. By 1972 the government seemed to have forgotten about all discussions around fencing off the burial ground or about the discovery of bones.</p>
<p>The Canadian government made a payment of 2.5 million dollars to the Kettle and Stony Point band in 1980 as partial compensation for the base lands. This was accompanied by a promise that the lands would be returned when military use had finally ceased (Edwards 2001, 60). In March 1992 a report was tabled by the Standing Committee on Aboriginal People recommending that the federal government return the Camp Ipperwash lands to the Stony Point community.</p>
<p>The people themselves followed this recommendation up a month later when a gathering of 100 showed up at Camp Ipperwash to serve an eviction notice on the Department of National Defense. The government was given 20 days to leave the premises (Edwards 2001, 61). The group of 100 included members of the National Association of Japanese Canadians. Their representative Van Hori noted that his community had also lost their homes and had their land expropriated by the government during World War Two. He stated: “It took us forty-six years to get an apology and some kind of compensation&#8230;These people are still waiting” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 61). The Department of National Defense replied in August 1992 that there was still a need to keep the Camp Ipperwash lands.</p>
<p>For many in the community the time for waiting was over. Fifty years had passed since the government stole the lands. Forty-six years since the promised time of return. On May 27, 1993 the military base was reoccupied by an Indigenous group calling itself now the Stoney Point First Nation. They named the reclaimed lands Aushoodaana Anjibaajrg meaning “resting place.” Dudley George was among that original group of land reclaimers.</p>
<p>The occupiers built homes on the base, pitched tents, parked trailers. The soldiers at the base remained doing what exercises they could. The occupation grew to around 100 residents with dozens more visiting regularly and offering support. Indigenous groups from across Turtle Island sent visitors. The Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) offered solidarity in the form of timber for buildings and generators for power (Edwards 2001, 62). The happiness in the community was real. As Clifford George stated: “This is the first time in fifty years, since before the war, that we’ve all been together so close. We’re finally back together again, and that’s why we have such a good relationship&#8230;.I’m back to stay. They’ll have to carry me off and they better lock me up because the minute they let me loose, I’ll come back again” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 62). The community elected its own chief and council (outside the formal structures of the colonial Indian Act). This was an assertion of self-determination and self-governance. Traditional teachings were practiced. A peace tree was planted over a traditional stone axe. A month in the first permanent structure, a church, was completed (Edwards 2001, 63).</p>
<p>The military kept up low level Bell 212 helicopter flights for reconnaissance shining lights into the occupation camp. According to Clifford George: “Sometimes they flew so low they raised dust. They scare the kids and old people. I’m all in favour of laying of charges of harassment against the military” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 64). The helicopter crews that harassed the Stoney Point people had flown missions in the colonial deployment in Somalia.</p>
<p>The media war was also initiated against the Indigenous occupiers. Media began to portray them as terrorists not as a cheated community striving after decades to get their stolen lands back. In this the media were replaying by now well rehearsed narratives of Indigenous resistance as terrorism or criminality. Such discourses had only recently been trotted out and repeated for national and even international audiences during the Oka crisis of 1990.</p>
<p>In the federal budget speech of 1994 the government announced plans to negotiate the return of Camp Ipperwash lands. No date was given.</p>
<p>Enough was finally more than enough. On July 29, 1995, Stoney Point occupiers drove a yellow school bus through the doors of a base hall and refused to leave. The military simply withdrew. By the end of summer community members had secured contracts to maintain the base at ten dollars per hour. There was no violence.</p>
<p>On Monday, September 4, Labor Day, 1995, the Indigenous protesters occupied Ipperwash Provincial Park, as they had, in fact, promised to do. There were about 35 occupiers in the park on the first evening. Police knew from the start that this occupation differed from other recent occupations such as Oka in Quebec and Gustafsen Lake in British Columbia. Their own briefing notes reported “no visible weapons” (Edwards 2001, 75). And their observers suggested the occupation was not well organized.</p>
<p>Still police right away put in motion plans to move more than 200 officers to the area along with caged Corrections Canada buses (Edwards 2001, 75). The Forest arena was commandeered as an arrest center. Police had also made arrangements with the Canadian military for use of armored personnel carriers. Project Maple was underway. The social war character of the police operation and response to Indigenous occupiers was unescapable. It would soon claim its casualties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Police Assault on Ipperwash and the Killing of Dudley George</p>
<p>Throughout Tuesday, September 5, and Wednesday, September 6, 1995, dozens of out of town officers appeared in the area near the camp and park. There was a mass mobilization of police force which seemed well out of proportion given the small numbers of community occupiers and the peaceful, by all accounts, nature of the protest.</p>
<p>Police roadblocks were set up on roads around the park and drivers were stopped and questioned. Indigenous drivers and passengers were subjected to particularly lengthy interrogations by police. The night of the police assault police shut down all roads around the park and military base sealing the protesters off from the outside world. Dozens of police vehicles, including containment vans, had been massed outside the park.</p>
<p>Numerous people, like Kettle and Stony Point band councillor Cecil Bernard, told OPP officers during the occupation that the occupiers were “good, peaceful people” (Edwards 2001, 1). They also noted that they felt that the officers did not care or were almost disappointed to hear this.</p>
<p>On the evening of the lethal police raid that killed Dudley George there were only about 25 people inside the park and this included some children (Edwards 2001, 2). The occupiers had no weapons in the park. In fact weapons had been banned by occupiers who realized they could not win in a shootout with police, which they did not seek anyway, and having weapons could be potentially disastrous.</p>
<p>The police maneuvers that resulted in the killing of Dudley George were military in character. The riot squad, the Crowd Management Unit, that moved on the camp was made up of the OPP Tactics and Rescue Unit (TRU) a paramilitary formation (Edwards 2001, 3). They consisted of scouts and snipers. It was never quite clear how the decision to send in the TRU was ever arrived at and ordered.</p>
<p>At one point earlier in the evening they had almost claimed a different victim, also unarmed. A TRU sniper had eyed what he believed to be an Indigenous person with a rifle standing at the side of the road. He also saw what he believed to be the reddish glow from a night vision riffle scope. What happened next is chilling. The officer reported into his radio: “CMU [Crowd Management Unit] be advised party on road may have a weapon in his hand. Check CMU person on the road does have a weapon, does have a weapon. Everybody move. Right, left, quick right, left, quick right, left, quick right, left, everybody quick right. Left” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 3). The sniper dropped into position taking aim on the figure, awaiting the order to “Fire.” The man was that close to being dead. As automatic weapons trained on him snipers confirmed the perceived threat. A police scout: “Confirm one man with weapon—long gun” (Edwards 2001, 3). That close.</p>
<p>But the police were mistaken. A message from Constable Mark Beauchene to Acting Sergeant Ken Deane clarified that the man in the crosshairs did not actually have a gun at all. He carried a walking stick. The red glow from the night sight—a lit cigarette (Edwards 2001, 3). And he was that close to being killed right then and there. Under eerily similar circumstances of police error and confusion Dudley George would not escape with such fortune.</p>
<p>Still the CMU continued their ill advised march on the camp. Near the park entrance protesters would see about 30 of them marching toward them in a tight box formation. Years before concerns would be more constantly raised about the militarization of policing, this formation of the riot squad came forward in head to toe body armor, with shin and elbow pads, holding Plexiglas shields and steel batons. They wore heavy helmets not meant to communicate with those they were approaching (to serve and protect of course). Rather their intended communications were only with each other. The helmets were equipped with internal microphones.</p>
<p>Police began pounding on the shields with their batons, “shield chatter,” in the tried and true attempt to intimidate, distract, and terrorize. This was nothing less than a military formation on a military maneuver. It was designed to frighten and threaten and, if necessary, to inflict lethal force. It had no other purpose or intent.</p>
<p>In response the protesters were not fully intimidated. Some turned high powered spotlights on the officers. Lights, symbolically, ironically, illuminating a situation from the history of Canadian settler colonialism—the deployment of military force to drive Indigenous people off of their lands. And the protesters were explicit that they recognized and understood this. They responded to the CMU appropriately: “This is our traditional land. Our forefathers were here before you! Get back on the <em>Mayflower</em>! Go back with the Pilgrims” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 5). And: “You’re stealing our land! Go back to England! Get the fuck off our land!” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 5). The land reclaimers were justly defiant. They were no aggressive or violent. None of that mattered to police who were impatient to deploy force against the protesters (for reasons not immediately apparent perhaps but politically significant).</p>
<p>Riot squad officers initially made a raid against Indigenous people in the parking lot. Police adopted a spread formation, standing wide apart to look more menacing and to avoid projectiles (Edwards 2001, 5). Moments later the police charged the group again. Indigenous protesters were beaten, at least one into unconsciousness. Later in the attack a dog that was with the protesters would be shot and killed by police. In the end, in addition to Dudley George, 16-year-old Nicholas Cottrelle would also be shot in the volleys of dozens of bullets fired by police at Indigenous protesters. Cecil Slippery George would be beaten almost to death by police. A dog that was with Cottrelle on a bus the youth tried to drive out of danger was also shot and killed.</p>
<p>Ken “Tex” Deane, the officer  who shot and killed Dudley George, was armed with an East German Heckler and Koch submachine gun. It fired 800 rounds a minute. Deane had been on duty for sixteen hours. Another officer, Sergeant George Hebblethwaite, second in command of the riot squad, recognized that George appeared to be holding only a stick (Edwards 2001, 10). Yet, in what would be found in a trial and inquiry after the killing to be unwarranted and unjustifiable use of force, Deane opened fire anyway. Deane hit George with what were the second and third volleys of bullets he fired. The third volley delivered the lethal shot.</p>
<p>Dudley George&#8217;s sister Carolyn and brother Pierre tried  frantically to get their stricken sibling to the local hospital for urgently needed care. They placed him in a car and made a desperate run for the hospital. What played out was an horrific expression of police vengeance and pettiness. Police attempted at every turn to stop the vehicle carrying the badly wounded Dudley George and the frantic effort to save his life saw the vehicle circumvent several would be roadblocks and out-maneuver the police pursuit.  Incredibly they managed to get Dudley to Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital in Strathroy, Ontario. The nightmare did not end when they got there.</p>
<p>Police chose to arrest and detain Pierre George and Carolyn George, who delivered Dudley to the hospital, rather than get the dying man immediate medical attention. Young Nicolas Cottrelle, only 16, who was also shot by police would  himself be charged by police with attempted murder. With 28 blunt force trauma wounds across his body delivered by police, Slippery George was charged with assault. The laying of charges against people who have been violently attacked by police is a standard practice that is all too familiar to people who have engaged in political protests in Canada. It is a practice that has become routine.</p>
<p>Dudley’s brother Pierre and sister Carolyn, who had so desperately tried to save their brother’s life were put in the Strathroy town jail and each charged with attempted murder. Police at the jail refused to answer Pierre George’s repeated requests to find out how Dudley was. Somehow though they knew.</p>
<p>Dudley George suffered fractures of the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs on his left side, a cracked collar bone, and had two large fragments of bullets in the subcutaneous soft tissues (Edwards 2001, 20). The young man, a beloved jokester, was declared dead at 12:20 AM on September 7, 1995, at nearby Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital, in Strathroy, Ontario.</p>
<p>Anthony O&#8217;Brien George (March 17, 1957–September 7, 1995), known to friends and family as Dudley, was the eighth of ten children born to Geneviève (“Jenny”) Pauline Rogers George and Reg “Nug” (Reginald Ransford) George.</p>
<p>Kettle and Stony Point Chief, Tom Bressette, described the sense of terror inflicted on the community by police. In his words: “Our elders were fleeing the community&#8230;They were afraid the army would come back with the police and kill them” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 22). The history of violence inflicted on the community and the immediate killing of their neighbor Dudley gave them ample reason to feel threatened. As would be revealed in the pubic inquiry held years later the community without fully knowing it perhaps had larger political reasons to be fearful. The government was fully prepared to deploy, indeed desired, police terror against the community to break the occupation.</p>
<p>The morning after the killing of Dudley George, Premier Harris refused to meet with Chief Bressette, Assembly of First Nations head Ovid Mercredi, and Ontario Chief Gord Peters. Harris referred to the occupation as illegal even though senior government ministers knew it was likely fully legal given the existence of burial grounds in the park (Edwards 2001, 118). The claim of Indigenous illegality was a claim Harris would repeat publicly even days later. After the killing the military tried to denigrate Dudley George by suggesting he had an “extreme criminal record” (Edwards 2001, 116). This was in no way accurate. He had one arrest as a youth (in an event for which white youth also involved were never even charged).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Racism and Colonialism Continued: Law and Order Conservatism and the Ipperwash Siege</p>
<p>The community members believed early on that Conservative Premier Mike Harris was responsible for the lethal police operation. Harris and his hard Right neoliberal Conservative Party government had only been elected three months before the killing of Dudley George. His government had made clear in their election campaign that they would make poor and working class communities scapegoats for social discontent and economic uncertainty. The suffering of the poor and unemployed would pay for social programs desired by the wealthy (through a massive transfer of social wealth away from services needed by the poorest members of society). They were an openly reactionary force for capital and fierce proponents of a neoliberal austerity agenda and tough on crime politics of repression.</p>
<p>Under the banner of their so-called “Common Sense Revolution” the Harris Tories launched a counter-revolutionary assault against poor people, welfare recipients, unions, students, community groups, and progressives of all types. At one point a year into his term Harris would target even sociologists (who were critical of anti-social government policy) labeling the discipline as “waste in the system” of post-secondary education.</p>
<p>Harris had, as official Opposition leader, made his racist views on Indigenous communities, and common sense, known to a group of business people (his people) at the Elmhurst Resort near Peterborough. According to Harris: “There’s a whole notion of guilt&#8230;because Native people haven’t fully adapted from the reservations [reserves] to being full partners in this economy. We can’t let that guilt preclude us from reaching a common sense solution” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 26). Common sense to Harris was justification for ongoing colonialism. Hs was, on the whole, an agenda of ramped up violence in service of primitive accumulation and renewed conditions for exploitation more favorable to capital (against policies and programs that offered some buffer for the working class and oppressed.</p>
<p>Among the changes introduced early by Premier Harris was the ending of employment equity legislation that would have had employers make plans to hire visible minorities, women, and Indigenous people (Edwards 2001, 26). This was the common sense counter-revolution for Ontario. Notably this agenda would be taken nationally when the revamped Conservative Party under Stephen Harper came to power between 2005 and 2015 with several veterans of Harris’s Common Sense Revolution as ministers in the federal cabinet.</p>
<p>From the start police were aware that they were being watched closely by the Premier’s office and Conservative Party. The first day of the operation Conservative MPP Marcel Beaubien arrived on the scene and was in communication with the government at Queen’s Park. The earliest government meetings expressed an intention to “remove the occupiers ASAP” (Edwards 2001, 80). The Conservative Party had campaigned on a hard law and order platform of zero tolerance for even minor offenses and the quelling of political dissent. The Premier’s office sought to use the excuse of break and enter or property damage to push it law and order agenda and sought signs of weapons.</p>
<p>Conservative MPP Beaubien released a press statement replaying racist claims about a two-tiered justice system that was soft on Natives, compared, again in racist fashion, to non[-Native people who were presented as “law abiding and tax paying citizens” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 82). The Indigenous community members were described as “irresponsible, law breaking dissidents” despite the fact that the occupation had not been declared illegal by anyone formally or charges prepared (quoted in Edwards 2001, 82). These claims played on racist tropes familiar in the history of Canadian colonialism and cultural erasure of Indigenous peoples. To add a further racist plum MPP Beaubien tried to distinguish between “your decent native citizen” and “thugs” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 82). Another referent from Canadian colonial discourse.</p>
<p>MPPs like Beaubien were ratcheting up tensions and calling on the Premier’s office for a forceful and swift intervention. Pressure was also coming from Conservative Party supporters. A letter from a local lawyer to the government was circulated saying in part: “The Conservative government had a large law and order plank in its platform—I want to see it live up to its election promises and my expectations. I want to see Ipperwash Provincial Park remain in the public domain, and I want the law enforced to see that it does” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 88). The letter writer raised the clichéd specter of anarchy and showed little regard for the wellbeing of protesters: “The time to act, and act decisively, is now. If people are hurt, so be it—the laws must be enforced to be respected&#8230;.If illegal acts are tolerated, they spread. The end result is anarchy” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 88). This from a lawyer promoting illegal police action against Indigenous people who, on the basis of the known burial site on the lands were not actually acting illegally (which it turns out the government was aware of). An open call for potential extrajudicial execution of land defenders.</p>
<p>Ironically the statement offered a note that expressed the very situation of the Indigenous community that had waited 50 years to get their land back. It read: “People begin to perceive the government cannot protect them and their interests—they begin to take steps to protect themselves” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 88). Meant as a threat this actually explained the situation of the land reclaimers who were being targeted for condemnation.</p>
<p>The appeals of the non-Natives and the racist messaging was not lost o the government which agreed with such sentiments. In meetings of the provincial Emergency Planning Committee, notes show clearly that the Conservative government would accept no compromise and would accept nothing, in fact, except the forced removal of the reclaimers. The government would not negotiate. Neither would they consider, incredibly, that the Indigenous people actually had legitimate claims on the lands. This intransigence was in place even as experts informed them that there were no legal grounds for removal of the occupiers. Stunningly, the government’s own files contained proof of the existence of the burial ground inside the park.</p>
<p>The government had already decided to seek an <em>ex parte</em> injunction against the Indigenous protesters. This would ban them from making any argument of their case in the courts, excluding them from the process. It was a measure usually reserved for extreme cases (Edwards 2001, 91). Excluded from the hearing they could not argue or provide evidence for their reasons for being on the land. The police were granted the <em>ex parte</em> injunction for four days.</p>
<p>Notes show that the government asked police to remove the protesters and showed frustration that the police did not do so immediately. The government wanted “to be seen as acting” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 89). The government even rejected possible assistance from Kettle and Stony Point band chief Tom Bressette. According to notes: “This government will not be seen as cooperating with the Indians” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 90).</p>
<p>Racism played an active part in the approach taken by police as well as by government. Protesters reported police hurling racist epithets at them throughout the occupation and police assault on the reclamation camp and saying Dudley George, by name, would “be the first” (Edwards 2001, 86). Police communication suggested that Native occupiers had been drinking even though there was no sign they were drinking and that they had, in fact, said they wanted no drinking among people at the site. According to police transcripts, OPP Superintendent Anthony Parkin said of the land reclaimers: “They’re probably all boozed up. They’ve probably been drinking” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 98). The police also suggested cynically that some occupiers were leaving because they knew trouble was coming. Yet they had actually left because they had school and jobs to go to (Edwards 2001, 98). This fact never occurred to police steeped in colonial racist ideology of unemployed, uneducated, Natives. The police also played on racist constructions of Indigenous people as untrustworthy and crooked. Toward this end the police spread rumors in the local area about native occupiers stealing gas. This was designed to stoke suspicion and anger among local farmers, business people, and town residents.</p>
<p>Police and government documents would show a close relationship between the provincial government and the OPP, even in contravention of law and public policy separating government from policing operations. OPP Commissioner Thomas O’Grady was a member of a joint crisis team that met regularly beginning one month before Dudley George was killed by police. So close was the relationship that the OPP had been nicknamed the “Ontario Political Police” (Edwards 2001, 120). The joint team was viewed as a legitimate vehicle <em>for</em> government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social War Policing and the Killing of Dudley George</p>
<p>In a case that underlines the state-capital nexus in policing, and the police as social war defenders of capital, the police also received an armored personnel carrier directly from the manufacturer, GM Diesel, in the nearby city of London, Ontario. Of note, the factory had a special agreement with the London police to provide it armored vehicles in times of police need. The only conceivable possible need was crowd control and anti-protest maneuvers.</p>
<p>The  infamous Chief of Police for London at the time, one Julian Fantino (known for racial profiling during his time as chief in York, Ontario and for keeping a list of gay men while in London) agreed to loan a vehicle to the OPP for the siege of Ipperwash. Fantino would, several years later, be head of the OPP at the time of the Six Nations occupation at Caledonia, Ontario. There the police would notoriously assault the occupation in violation of the recommendations that arose following the police murder of Dudley George. OPP under Fantino would also protect white supremacists who sought to attack the Six Nations reclamation.</p>
<p>The military nature of the police action was further reinforced with the use of air cover through helicopter flyovers. Occupiers had noted surveillance by low flying police helicopters as well as shoreline patrols by a police boat. The Indigenous land reclaimers were being encircled on land and in the air. And even by water. Around the clock. This was a full on military siege. At the same time they actually consisted of a grand total of nine people, including three children (Edwards 2001, 80). At one point a police helicopter buzzed so low on a picnic of women and children that it blew their food off the table (Edwards 2001, 86).</p>
<p>The OPP made informal requests for help to the Canadian military. OPP were in communication with the military over a plan to outnumber Natives ten to one (rather than the two to one ratio in effect when Dudley George was killed). Unfortunately for their plan available troops were preparing to fight an external imperial battle in Bosnia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surveillance and Police Spies</p>
<p>As in traditional military operations the state also deployed special ops against the occupiers. At least one spy provided information over a period of time to both CSIS and the OPP. The one identified spy was Jim Moses, a journalist who had contributed to various Indigenous media as well as mainstream outlets like the state broadcaster the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and its investigative newsmagazine <em>The Fifth Estate</em> (Edwards 2001, 69). CSIS was particularly interested in involvement by or connections with the Mohawk Warrior Society, noted for activism and community defense at Akwesasne and Oka. Moses reported being paid around $2000 by the OPP over almost three years of spying on Indigenous groups. CSIS paid between 400 dollars and 800 dollars per month (Edwards 2001, 69).</p>
<p>Notably, over his period with the Stoney Point occupiers Moses could find and report no wrongdoing by the group. This despite the fact that it would have been beneficial financially for him to do so. Moses went on to stay with the occupiers at the military base. He never saw any guns at the occupation. He regarded Dudley George as a joker rather than a fighter or leader (Edwards 2001, 70). He expressed deep sadness at George’s killing. In his words: “Dudley was a happy-go-lucky friendly guy&#8230;I was sick. I felt empty&#8230;It was totally unnecessary” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 70). This from the police infiltrator.</p>
<p>The OPP also used officers posing as tourists to spy on Indigenous people along the park beach. In addition two undercover officers were placed in the camp posing as campers. They operated out of a trailer and a mobile home (Edwards 2001, 70). Notably they too had nothing threatening or ominous to report about the activities of the occupiers.</p>
<p>The OPP’s military Tactics and Rescue Unit had been formed specifically to address terrorism (in the period before 9/11). It’s deployment and dubious use in this situation show both the government view of Indigenous land defense and the misuse for purely politically opportunistic purposes various “anti-terror” mechanisms. Notably the police construction of Indigenous land defenders as terrorists continues in recent surveillance and response to Indigenous pipeline resistance in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>The police, despite massive surveillance and  an infiltrator in the occupation camp, had no evidence, at any point, of any danger posed by the land reclaimers.  Yet the government took the extreme measure of gaining an <em>ex parte</em> injunction against the occupiers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Inquiry and a Killer Cop Convicted</p>
<p>In a rare turn of events in the Canadian state context, where police are almost never charged or brought to trial for killing civilian, the officer who killed Dudley George, Acting Sergeant Ken “Tex” Deane was actually charged and his case tried in a court of law. Deane put forward a defense that he believed Dudley George to be carrying a rifle at the time he shot the young man. The presiding judge did not accept this Defense and found Deane’s claims to lack credibility, a rare conclusion regarding police officer testimony in cases where officers are charged for killing someone. According to Judge Hugh Fraser: “I find, sir, that you were not honest in presenting this version of events to the Ontario Provincial Police investigators. You were not honest in presenting this version of events to the Special Investigations Unit of the Province of Ontario. You were not honest in maintaining this ruse before this court” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 198). Deane was found guilty of criminal negligence but sentenced to a non-custodial punishment. For killing Dudley George in cold blood Tex Deane was given a conditional sentence of two years less a day which was to be served in the community (Edwards 2001, 214).</p>
<p>Despite the conviction, Tex Deane did not lose his job as a police officer. He maintained his employment with the force for five-and-a-half years following the criminal conviction. Over that time Officer Deane appealed his conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal and eventually all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. Finally, in the wake of a hearing under the Police Act, Deane was additionally convicted of Discreditable Conduct. He was given the option of resigning within seven days or being fired and left the force. Deane would go on to work as a security guard, unsettlingly, at an Ontario Hydro nuclear station.</p>
<p>Tex Deane was killed in a car accident on February 25, 2006. Ironically perhaps, his vehicle collided with a truck near Prescott, Ontario while Deane was traveling to testify in the provincial inquiry called into the government handling of the Ipperwash crisis (Harris 2006).</p>
<p>Following the police killing of Dudley George the George family made ongoing calls for both the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada to strike a public inquiry into the handling of the response to the land reclamation at Ipperwash by the province and the police. They wanted to know especially the nature and extent of government involvement in directing police operations against the Indigenous community protesters.</p>
<p>Finally, on November 12, 2003, a public inquiry was launched in Ontario. This only happened after the ruling Conservative Party lost the election of 2003 to the Liberal Party headed by Dalton McGuinty. The Conservatives had held to power and refused an inquiry into their actions for eight years.</p>
<p>While the inquiry was funded by the Government of Ontario it was carried out under a third party, Sidney B. Linden, who was deemed to be neutral. Linden derived his authority as a commissioner as covered by the Public Inquiries Act (Ontario). The public inquiry was given the specific mandate to examine and report on the events surrounding the killing of Dudley George. This was not a trial and no punishment would be levied. It was expected that the inquiry would provide recommendations covering interactions between police and Indigenous communities in future events of similar nature to the Ipperwash protests.</p>
<p>Evidence provided over the course of the inquiry was damning of the Conservative government’s racism and contempt for Indigenous communities. It also showed dubious government relationships with police and pointed to government pressures on policing in the nature of a police state. At one point a 17-minute tape recording was submitted that revealed a stunning conversation between OPP Inspector Ron Fox and Inspector John Carson, the OPP commander in charge of the Ipperwash case before Dudley George was killed. The two officers discussed Premier Mike Harris&#8217;s aggressive and racist perspective that that the government has “tried to pacify and pander to these people far too long” and to use “swift affirmative action” to remove the Indigenous people from the park (Ipperwash Inquiry 2007). It could be said that this was the only time in his period in office that Mike Harris supported any form of affirmative action.</p>
<p>Perhaps most damning was shocking evidence provided by former Ontario Provincial Attorney General Charles Harnick on November 28, 2005. Harniick testified that Premier Harris used extreme profanity while shouting, “I want the fucking Indians out of my park” (Ipperwash Public Inquiry 2005).</p>
<p>Former Premier Mike Harris did appear reluctantly before the inquiry on February 14, 2006. Harris denied in his testimony that he had ever made the statement attributed to him by Harnick (CBC News 2006). Notably, Justice Linden “found the statements were made and they were racist, whether intended or not” (Ipperwash Inquiry, Volume 1 2007, 677).</p>
<p>The evidentiary hearings portion of the inquiry ended on June 28, 2006. The final report from Justice Linden and the overall findings of the inquiry were released on May 31, 2007 (CBC News 2007). They concluded that the Premier’s office and the police had acted inappropriately and improperly in the events at Ipperwash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not in Vain: Victory to the Occupiers and the Return of the Lands</p>
<p>The killing of Dudley George can only be considered a state atrocity, an extrajudicial execution carried out on behalf of a government that sought to show it was tough of protesters and, more, an upholder of the colonial power relations at the heart of the Canadian state. But Dudley George’s death was not in vain. His people would emerge victorious in this particular struggle despite the efforts of the Ontario government. Unfortunately this victory, and confirmation of the rightness of their struggle, would only come 12 years after Dudley George was killed.</p>
<p>On December 20, 2007, the Ontario Provincial government, now under Liberal Party direction, made a public announcement that it would finally return the full acreage of Ipperwash Provincial Park to its proper inhabitants, the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation (Gillespie 2007). This initial announcement did not make full return of the lands immediately since the land was placed under co-management by the provincial government and the Indigenous communities for an unspecified period of time. The government also announced that there would be consultations carried out with nearby local communities (non-Indigenous). Then-Aboriginal Affairs Minister Michael Bryant suggested that the land would be turned over to full Chippewa control at the end of this consultation process.</p>
<p>The date finally came on Thursday May 28, 2009, when then-Ontario Aboriginal Affairs Minister Brad Duguid formally signed control of Ipperwash Park over to the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation (McCaffery 2009). The full settlement was only finalized on April 14, 2016, a delay for the community of more than 70 years after the government’s promised return of the end of World War Two. The land was turned over to the community along with a  payment of $95 million. The Federal government was represented in the signing over by Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan and Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Dr. Carolyn Bennett. Signing the agreement on behalf of the First Nation was Chief Thomas Bressette (Bridge 2016).</p>
<p>It should also be noted that some members of the community have opposed the agreement as too little too late. Pierre George was engulfed in flames during a protest prior to the signing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CODA: They are the Government. We Can Never Trust the Police</p>
<p>Peter Edwards gives a sense of the hegemonic view of policing held by most media members, but which Indigenous communities hold with skepticism. According to the reporter:</p>
<p>“It’s a basic understanding in a democracy that police keep a professional distance from politicians It has to be this way. Otherwise, police would soon find themselves ordered to crack down on the political rivals of whoever is in office, ass happens in Third World police states. That would be the certain death of democracy.” (Edwards 2001, 24)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well then democracy in Canada is already dead. Killed by police. As each of the cases of activists killed by police in Canada shows the ruling politicians and political parties do not keep a distance from police. Regularly they engage with, direct, and/or pressure police to act with violence <em>for political purposes</em> and <em>toward political ends</em>. The police killing of Dudley George was no different in this respect.</p>
<p>One Indigenous woman offered an alternative view of the hegemonic perspective on [police as peacekeepers. In her view: “They [the police] are the government. We can never trust the police” (quoted in Edwards 2001, 25). This is a clear sighted and correct criminological analysis of the historic and contemporary character of policing in Canada. Despite what the national mythologies might have one believe.</p>

<p>Killer cops, their forces, and their police associations are regularly coming up with euphemisms and bogus “conditions” to excuse or legitimize their killings. The litany includes “excited delirium,” “suicide by cop,” and the mystical “sudden death.” The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians is investigating a case that police are calling “sudden death” in Chatham, Ontario on July 26, 2017.</p>
<p>Sometime on the night of July 25, Chatham-Kent police responded to a 911 call allegedly involving a domestic dispute. According to the SIU police remained outside the house on Greenfield Lane for quite some time.</p>
<p>Then the storyline jumps dramatically with no explanation. The SIU reports police entered the house at around 7:00 AM and—huge jump here—a 52-year old man, since identified as Shawn Davis, was pronounced dead at the scene (killed?, found dead?, etc.?). No one is saying. But sudden death does not cut it.</p>
<p>CKPS Constable Kelly Helbin said police would not release any other information. This only adds to the sense of police acting suspiciously in this case.</p>

<p>It has been announced that Caleb Tubila Njoko, a 26-year-old Black man who reportedly fell from a 15th floor balcony during a police operation in London, Ontario, on May 4, 2020, has died. Mr. Njoko died on May 8, but his death was only confirmed by the Special Investigations Unit on June 3. There has been no public explanation for the delay in this.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, is investigating. They report that London police responded to 85 Walnut Street on May 4 at around 11:15 PM on a call of a person in distress. Officers entered an apartment on the 15th floor and, at some point, the victim “fell” from a balcony. He was taken to hospital in critical condition and died there four days later.</p>
<p>This is the second Black person to have been killed in what is reported publicly as a fall from a balcony during a police operation in Ontario in May alone. On May 27, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a 29-year-old Black woman, was killed in a “fall” from an apartment balcony in Toronto. Family members and witnesses report that she was shoved off the balcony by Toronto police. Because police control the information that is released when they kill, their version of events must be treated with skepticism and there is a real need to hear from witnesses, if any were present.</p>
<p>Notably, both of these deaths involved police interventions against someone in distress. Police are not suitable for mental health care or interacting with people in distress. Proper health supports and care are needed but are denied resources when those resources go instead to police budgets.</p>

<p>Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents nearly 50 Indigenous communities in northern Ontario, expressed great concern over the two deaths in two days. In his words: “It’s very troubling. The families have a lot of questions” (quoted in Perkel 2018).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deaths at the Hands of Police</p>
<p>Details about both deaths are limited so far. Police control information about their killings and deaths related to their activities. This is a problem across Canada in terms of policing. Police did not release the names of their victims. The names were conformed by multiple other sources, including federal Member of Parliament Charlie Angus.</p>
<p>With regard to the police shooting of Joey Knapaysweet, the province’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has only said that  there was “an interaction” between officers and the victim and an officer discharged a firearm striking the man.</p>
<p>Agnes Sutherland was arrested at a shelter after having been asked to leave the Timmins District Hospital, where she had sought help. She was taken to a police station and put in a cell on Saturday, the same day Knapaysweet was killed. Later that same evening she was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead late Sunday.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by Indigenous leaders Grand Chief Fiddler, Grand Chief Jonathan Solomon of the Mushkegowuk Council, and Fort Albany First Nation Chief Andrew Solomon, serious questions are raised: “It is alleged that when police attended at the scene of the local shelter, Ms. Sutherland was treated roughly while being taken into police custody. She suffered severe complications during her detention” (quoted in Perkel 2018).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Systemic Racism and Colonial Legacies</p>
<p>In their statement, Grand Chief Fiddler, Grand Chief Solomon and Chief Andrew Solomon call for a timely and thorough investigation. They raise the very real issues of racism in policing and the violence targeted at Indigenous people by police. In their words: “We have seen systemic racism in the city of Thunder Bay, and must now wonder if this is also happening in Timmins” (quoted in Perkel 2018).</p>
<p>Notably, Timmins Mayor Steve Black acknowledged that the deaths at the hands of police had increased racial tensions in the city, though he did not specify. He said: “I don’t believe there’s room for racism in any community. If changes need to be made or things need to be done to improve those relationships, we’re definitely willing to work with our partners on improving those relationships” (quoted in Perkel 2018). No word on whether that includes dismantling settler colonial police forces (or mayoralties). He has, though, condemned people who have spoken out against the police and their actions on social media (CBC News 2018).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Health Care Not Cops</p>
<p>According to the Chiefs, both victims had left the remote community of Fort Albany, near Ontario’s James Bay coast, to seek medical care in Timmins. They note in their statement: “Our people must continually leave their families and communities to come to cities to seek services that are not available in their respective communities” (quoted in 2018). The deaths come as an emergency summit is being held in Timmins by the Mushkegowuk Council this week. The regional James Bay government declared a state of emergency in November, concerned over the growing number of drugs and alcohol coming into its seven member communities (CBC News 2018).</p>
<p>Sutherland’s son, Glen Sutherland, told the <em>Timmins Daily Press</em> that his mother was a survivor of the notorious St. Anne’s residential school. He said that she needed a wheelchair to get around, and questioned the actions of hospital staff. She was using a wheelchair at the time of her arrest. Glen Sutherland said that her frequent trips to the emergency room were a cry for help (Perkel 2018). She was a mother of six with six great grandchildren.</p>
<p>The mistreatment at hospitals of Indigenous people seeking medical assistance has been a disturbing, and too common, issue in various locations in Canada, including infamous cases in Winnipeg, Manitoba that have gained some national attention. It speaks to ongoing legacies of colonialism and racism in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>A vigil in Timmins for Knapaysweet on Tuesday, February 6, drew around 100 people. Chief Andrew Solomon is calling on the Attorney General of Ontario and the Minister of Community Safety to investigate the Timmins Police (CBC News 2018).</p>
<p>Police and criminal justice systems more broadly in Canada disproportionately target Indigenous people and disproportionately target them for violence. Criminal justice systems, including police forces, were founded as instruments of settler colonialism, occupation, dispossession, and displacement and this must always be front and center in discussions of policing in the country.</p>

<p>On February 12, 2014, York Regional Detective Remo Romano struck and killed 18-year-old pedestrian Natasha “Carla” Abogado while driving at speeds of 115 km/h in a 60 km/h zone on a busy Toronto street. January 17, 2018, found Romano on trial for the third time for the killing.</p>
<p>His first trial in May 2016 ended in a mistrial when the jury could not reach a verdict. He was acquitted in a second trial later that year but the Ontario Court of Appeal ordered a retrial based on flaw’s in the trial judge’s charge to the jury. Romano is pleading not guilty. At the outset of the current trial, Superior Court Justice Todd Ducharme told the jury not to research the case, including what happened in the previous proceedings.</p>
<p>Detective Romano struck Abogado while she was crossing mid-block to her family’s home on the south side of St. Clair Avenue East, on her way home from a part-time job. Romano was speeding eastward on St. Clair Ave. E., trying to catch up with other police surveillance members of Project Litterbox, a YRP surveillance investigation into a series of non-violent commercial break-ins where around $500,000 in cosmetics and perfumes had been stolen. He was driving an unmarked truck with no sirens or flashing lights. Romano was trying to catch up to the other officers because he had been at the station retrieving another officer’s firearm that had been forgotten in a desk drawer.</p>
<p>According to the opening statement by Crown attorney Rebecca Schwartz, Romano was driving 115 km/hr in a 60 km/hr zone near a seniors’ health centre. Detective William Newton, who travelled in a police vehicle behind Romano, stated that no arrests were imminent as they sped along the busy avenue. He said that Romano was simply “trying to catch up to the action” (Mandel 2018).</p>
<p>Witness Dorota Taylor saw two police vehicles speed past her. In her testimony: “I thought they were racing because of how close they were to each other and the speed that they were going” (quoted in Mandel 2018).</p>
<p>The jury was told that a senior collision reconstructionist from the Special Investigations Unit, the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, will testify that if Romano had  been doing even 80 km/hr that night (instead of nearly twice the legal limit) he would have been able to avoid hitting Abogado.</p>
<p>We need to remember that killer cop Romano was speeding at twice the legal limit with no lights or sirens to catch up with surveillance team members who were working on a case protecting wealth for private companies, not responding to any immediate threat (and certainly no violent one) to the public. He simply wanted to be part of “the action.” And he killed Natasha Abogado to do so.</p>

<p>Detective-Constable Remo Romano, a York police officer, will be headed to trial for a third time on charges of dangerous driving causing death for the killing of 18-year-old pedestrian Natasha Carla Abogado in February 2014. Romano (45) was on duty and behind the wheel of an undercover police pickup truck when he struck Natasha Abogado as she attempted to cross St. Clair Avenue East around 8 PM.</p>
<p>Romano was traveling at a speed of least 109 kilometers per hour in a 60-km/hr zone. He was reportedly trying to catch up to other members of his surveillance team, not I active pursuit of anyone.</p>
<p>Romano was tried in May 2016, but a jury was did not come to a unanimous verdict after a few days of deliberating, resulting in a mistrial. Romano was tried again in September 2016 and a jury acquitted him of dangerous driving causing death. Following that decision, the Crown prosecutor filed an appeal, citing issues with the way in which the judge directed the jury to come to its verdict (Beattie 2017).</p>
<p>On September 28, 2017, a panel of three court of appeal judges agreed with the Crown and ordered a new trial. They found that the trial judge, Justice Brian O’Marra, did wrongly explain the dangerous driving law to the jury. Specifically, the judge incorrectly instructed the jurors not only to focus on how Romano’s actions as a driver caused Abogado’s death, but also how the victim Abogado herself might have been at fault (Beattie 2017). Another case of victim blaming to excuse or justify a police killing of a civilian.</p>
<p>Justice David Paciocco said in his decision: “Most significantly, the trial judge made irrelevant and adverse comments about Ms. Abogado’s conduct” (quoted in Beattie 2017).</p>
<p>Incredibly, according to Paciocco, O’Marra instructed the jury to consider that Abogado was jaywalking and described that as an “inherently risky activity” (despite the fact that people do it all the time without harm) and that “pedestrians must be aware, when they jaywalk, that drivers are not always paying attention, not always concentrating on what is going on ahead of them” (quoted in Beattie 2017). Even more O’Marra took a page out of the “what was she wearing” playbook for dismissing women victims of crime, and argued that Abogado’s clothing was dark and had “poor visibility” at the time of the collision (Beattie 2017). This was simply a replay, and reinforcement, of the Romano legal team’s defense ploy to get their client off.</p>
<p>The appeals decision noted that these statements turned the jury’s attention away from the central issue of whether or not Romano’s driving was itself, in fact, dangerous (Beattie 2017). By then the damage had been done to the Crown’s case. Concluded Paciocco: “The errors in the charge … are sufficiently serious that the jury was not in a position to evaluate properly the dangerousness of the operation of the motor vehicle, leading to a miscarriage of justice” (quoted in Beattie 2017).</p>
<p>At the second trial, Crown prosecutor Philip Perlmutter pointed out that Romano operated his vehicle at such a high rate of speed that it became impossible for him to adjust his driving in the event that something unexpected happened (Beattie 2017). Even more, his speeding was entirely unnecessary and unjustifiable according to the Crown. The surveillance operation that Romano was part of was only focused on intelligence-gathering and, as such, was neither dangerous nor urgent (Beattie 2017). It should never have resulted in the death of an innocent young woman.</p>
<p>York Regional police have confirmed that Detective-Constable Remo Romano is still an active officer on the force.</p>

<p>It is extremely rare in the Canadian state context for a police officer who kills a civilian to face charges. Even where charges are pursued in court killer cops are almost never found guilty by the system they uphold, protect, and service. The verdict in the case of York Regional Police officer Remo Romano who killed pedestrian Natasha Carla Abogado (18) on the evening of February 12, 2014 while speeding offers yet another sad case in point. On September 2, 2016 a jury declared Romano not guilty of dangerous driving causing death. Their decision came after seven hours of deliberations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Killing of Carla Abogado by Remo Romano</p>
<p>Detective-Constable Remo Romano (44) was driving an unmarked pickup truck at an incredible speed of 115 km/h, nearly double the 60 km/h speed limit, when he struck Abogado, killing her. The young victim was thrown approximately 80 meters and was declared dead on the scene in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, Ontario. Notably, Constable Romano did not have his sirens or lights activated (Yuen 2016a). At the time he hit and killed Abogado, Romano was part of a surveillance team, Project Litterbox, investigating a series of non-violent commercial break-ins involving major Canadian capitalist enterprises such as Shopper’s Drug Mart, according to details provided to the jury (Hasham 2016). They were said to be stealing…perfume (Mandel 2016). Far from being a threat or crucial pursuit situation, Romano had simply fallen behind the other officers in his team and was speeding to catch up to them when he struck Abogado who had just gotten off a bus on her way home.</p>
<p>Crown prosecutor Perlmutter informed the jury that the surveillance operation Romano was involved in at the time he killed Abogado was only involved in intelligence gathering and was by no means dangerous nor urgent (Hasham 2016). Certainly it was not a matter of life and death urgency that he catch up with his team (or he might not have been so lax in falling behind in the first place). According to Perlmutter: “(He was) not entitled to drive at those speeds, to put himself in position where he did not have the time and space to respond to a jaywalker. This did not justify the risk to the public” (quoted in Hasham 2016). And we might stress again that this was an operation in which the police were providing essentially private security services for Canadian capital. Revealing once more that essential and unwavering connection.</p>
<p>The Crown’s collision reconstruction expert informed the court that a car going more than 80 km/h would likely have hit Abogado but at a slower speed, that car could have been able to stop or swerve to avoid impact instead. It was also noted that anyone jaywalking would have estimating oncoming vehicles traveling at the speed limit of 60 km/h (Hasham 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blaming the Victim</p>
<p>Romano cynically blamed the victim on the stand stating: “She made the choice to step out in front of my vehicle” (quoted in Yuen 2016a). An incredibly callous and self-serving assertion.</p>
<p>Defense lawyer Bill MacKenzie also blamed the victim for jaywalking rather than using a crosswalk. He cynically called the killing a “tragic accident” and went on to blame her clothing choice (quoted in Hasham 2016). Even more MacKenzie used the old ploy of tempting a jury to feel sorry for an officer who would be disgraced by being convicted. He further suggested that there is a disjuncture between the identity of officer and the identity of criminal as if the two are mutually exclusive. And he slyly suggested to the jury that they did not want to be responsible for effecting such an outcome for a supposed community servant. In his words: “At what speed does he go from being a police officer serving his community to a convicted criminal?” (quoted in Hasham 2016).</p>
<p>Constable Romano suffered panic attacks and was prescribed the anti-anxiety medication later found in his bag at the site of the crash (Mandel 2016). He claimed it was “just there for security” and insisted he had not taken any the night of the crash (Mandel 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Family Devastated</p>
<p>This decision comes in Romano’s second trial. At an earlier trial in May, a jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict following two days of deliberations (Hasham 2016). Abogado’s family, who sat through both trials left the courtroom without common following the September verdict.</p>
<p>Carla Abogado’s father, Guillermo Abogado, expresses only disappointment with the verdict that has left the family further devastated. He worries for what the decision will men for other victims’ families as well. In his words:</p>
<p>“My whole family was very upset, we were expecting a guilty verdict. From Day 1 until now, it’s very hard for us. The jury are allowing the police officers to use 115 km/h on a busy street, near a hospital and subway station. I hope they have a conscience because it may happen again now. They’ve set a precedent. They’re allowing every police officer to do it again.” (quoted in Yuen 2016b).</p>
<p>The dissatisfaction with the court system is echoed by Paula Abogado, Carla’s sixteen-year- old younger sister. From her perspective: “With this, we were trying to find a little bit of closure, but now what are we going to get out of this? Every time there’s a trial we always get a reminder and it just brings us back to this place where we have no time to heal” (quoted in Yuen 2016b). Sadly this is the disappointing outcome experienced by almost all families of victims of police violence in Canada who expect justice through the court system.</p>
<p>Guillermo Abogado noted the difficulties and frustrations that families face when the killer of their loved one is a police officer. As he reflects, painfully: “We’re fighting a police officer, they have lots of support. I felt it was scripted. He faced the jury and was crying to get the sympathy of the jury. Maybe they felt it worked last time, so they’ll do it again” (quoted in Yuen 2016b). History in such cases in the Canadian context shows they do.</p>
<p>The Abogado family is also pursuing a $2.2 million civil suit against the York Regional Police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The verdict while not shocking given the historic lack of accountability for police officers who kill civilians did seem to skirt all reason. As the Crown prosecutor Philip Perlmutter laid out, Romano ignored the obvious and foreseeable risks of driving at such speeds through a residential area with both a seniors’ center and bus stop en route (Hasham 2016). According to Perlmutter: “(Abogado) died on account of a fatal combination of Mr. Romano’s excessive speed and lack of attention” (quoted in Hasham 2016). In support of business interests. And once again a killer cop is let off the hook despite what logic dictates.</p>

<p>There have been a large number of incidents of police driving at high speeds and/or in reckless fashion resulting in the deaths of uninvolved civilians over the last few years across Canada. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians has concluded that no criminal charges will be brought against an Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) officer in relation to the high speed police chase that resulted in the death of pedestrian Grace Glofcheskie in Guelph, Ontario in 2015. This despite the SIU investigation finding that the officer’s driving was “objectively dangerous” and his vehicle was in excess of 68 km/h over the posted speed limit at times during the chase.</p>
<p>The officer was pursuing an SUV whose driver was attempting to avoid a RIDE (drinking and driving) spot check on December 13, 2015. The chase went through Guelph’s downtown area. At its conclusion the SUV driver lost control, crossing onto a sidewalk and flipping. Grace Glofcheskie, who was walking home after visiting friends, was struck by the SUV. She was taken to hospital but died of her injuries. The SUV was later identified as stolen.</p>
<p>The SIU reported that it had assigned seven investigators, two forensic investigators, and one collision reconstructionist to the case. Six police officers and six civilians were interviewed for the investigation. The officer being investigated did not participate, nor did he provide a copy of his notes. This is a contentious part of SIU investigations, as police are legally allowed to withhold their notes, one which has been challenged by critics of the SIU and oversight procedures in Ontario.</p>
<p>There are some questions raised by the SIU report. Notably their conclusion not to bring any charges against the officer despite finding that his driving had been “objectively dangerous” in their words and the speeds of more than 68 km/h over the posted speed limit reached by the officer. The SIU explanation is also rather perplexing. It states: “However, the factual context does not allow me to conclude that the driving amounted to a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person in the same situation as the officer would have exercised in the circumstances” (SIU Release). It is hard to see how a civilian driving at such speeds over the posted limit and in an “objectively dangerous” manner would be viewed as so reasonable and would avoid charges. Indeed it is shown time and again that civilian drivers under less dangerous circumstances are charged.</p>

<p>A high speed police chase by members of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) ended in the death of Sheila Walsh (65), who was not the target of the chase. The driver of the pursued vehicle, a pickup truck, crashed into the vehicle being driven by Walsh with the truck bursting into flames. Walsh was declared dead at the scene. After the crash police told neighbors to evacuate their homes because of gasoline spilling out at the scene.</p>
<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines harm to civilians by police in Ontario, is investigating the high-speed pursuit and how OPP officers responded to the situation. According to the SIU, police claim that at about 3:20 PM on September 25, 2017, the OPP responded to a call about a reportedly stolen vehicle in Eganville, around 130 kilometers west of Ottawa. The 20-year-old driver of the vehicle in question headed toward Arnprior on Highway 60, then to Highway 17, where the OPP began their pursuit. The truck collided with Welsh’s car a bit after 4 PM as she was pulling from her driveway on Daniel Street.</p>
<p>The SIU has assigned five investigators, two forensic investigators, and one collision reconstructionist to investigate the crash and the circumstances leading to it. None of the police claims have been independently confirmed. It is known that the risky and careless police decision to pursue enforcement of property rights has led to the death of a civilian.</p>
<p>One witness put it in clearly sensible term, In the words of Eric Bayley, a Bell Canada worker who observed the chase and crash while working:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The chase should never have happened. If the guy robbed a bank they would have got him sooner or later. It was a stolen vehicle. Big freakin’ deal. Now a poor grandmother, mother, sister is dead. There’s no … way in hell those cops should have been chasing them down that … road.” (quoted in Crawford and Gillis 2017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continued Bayley:</p>
<p>“There had to have been eight cop cars and three Suburbans wide open going down Daniel Street. It could have been a lot worse. I was talking to my buddy on the phone and I was like, ‘Holy s—t. This is not going to go well.’ He said, ‘What’s going on?’ and I said, ‘There’s a high-speed chase. There’s cruiser after cruiser after cruiser.’” (quoted in Crawford and Gillis 2017)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, a  flag worker on construction site the chase plowed through had to leap to safety.</p>
<p>Ontario’s Police Services Act sets out the rules governing police pursuits. According to the Act, police can pursue or continue pursuit “if the police officer has reason to believe that a criminal offence has been committed or is about to be committed; or for the purposes of motor vehicle identification or the identification of an individual in the vehicle.” The Act also further states police must continually weigh whether “the immediate need to apprehend an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle or the need to identify the fleeing motor vehicle or an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle outweighs the risk to public safety that may result from the pursuit.” Dispatch must be notified of the pursuit and the (Crawford and Gillis 2017).</p>

<p>How does an argument between a landscape professional and a careless resident watering the lawn during a drought and city water use restrictions end up with the concerned landscaper being killed by police? How is it that a young man, described as quiet and peaceful, comes to be viciously attacked by police officers using chemical weapons and is beaten so brutally that his grieving family has to have a closed casket funeral?</p>
<p>These fundamental questions remain to be answered in the case of the police killing of Myles Gray. This despite the pleas of family members for information. Other fundamental questions stand out with regard to police involved killings of civilians in British Columbia. So too do questions about the supposed investigations unit and civilian concerns with oversight of police in the province.</p>
<p>How is it that in a province in which there is a supposedly independent investigations unit legislatively tasked with investigating all cases in which police harm or kill a civilian there is no report years after the killing? And how is it that despite requirements that police immediately notify the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) when such occasions of force against civilians have occurred, and involved officers not communicate with one another, that there can be both a delay in notification and communications between involved officers, yet no officer is punished or in any way held accountable? And why, in British Columbia, are so many families of victims killed by police left with no answers and no insights into the events that left their loved ones dead at the hands of officers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suing for Answers in the Police Killing of Myles Gray</p>
<p>Six months after their son was killed by police, under mysterious, troubling, and still shrouded circumstances, in a backyard in Burnaby, the parents of 33 year old Myles Gray are still seeking answers. Among the few basic facts that are known about the killing of Myles Gray on the afternoon of August 13, 2015, is that officers encountered the young man after responding to a call regarding a disturbance on the 3600 block of South East Marine Drive in Vancouver. It is also known that that afternoon Myles Gray, who worked as a greenery supplier to local florist wholesalers, had argued with a woman who was watering her garden during drought restrictions. Beyond that questions abound.</p>
<p>Having received no insights into their son’s death at the hands of police they have been compelled to file a lawsuit against the Vancouver police and 11 of the force’s officers. This is the only means available to them to get an honest response from police about what happened when their son’s life was taken.</p>
<p>In addition to the Vancouver Police Department and the officers, the Grays, along with Myles Gray’s evergreen supply company, Graystone Enterprises Ltd, also name the City of Vancouver and the Vancouver Police Board in the lawsuit. The board is cited for “failing properly and effectively to educate, train and supervise the officers to appropriate professional standards” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>In the suit, Myles Gray’s parents, Margie and Mark Gray of Sechelt, allege that seven of those officers, still identified only as “John Does,” wrongfully killed their son by beating him to death. According to the claim, the police killed Myles Gray by using “grossly excessive force” and “inflicting massive physical trauma … with no valid, lawful reason” (quoted in Rankin 2016). The suit also alleges that officers had no lawful cause or authority to detain Myles Gray and that he was repeatedly beaten, even after he had been restrained. All officers involved have been and remain on active duty since the killing.</p>
<p>Margie Gray reports being told that her son died within minutes of the encounter with Vancouver officers. Her assessment is stark, and accurate: “This is ‘comply or die’ policing. Like, what was the rush to move in and kill him?” (quoted in Rankin 2016). Adds Mark Gray: “You know, they could have let him calm down …. like a person’s life is worth more than a (few) minutes, right?” (quoted in Rankin 2016). The family, and indeed many reasonably thinking people, can envision a broad range of alternative approaches that could have been taken that would not have left a young man beaten to death.</p>
<p>Grieving father Mark Gray is left with the terrible question: “Why was he killed off, just hunted down like a dog, killed like a dog, worse than a dog?” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>Families of almost all victims of people killed by police in Canada are provided with very little information about what the police did to their loved ones. They are almost never given the names of officers involved as these are not even made available to the general public. This is the case for Myles Gray’s parents. Their requests are straightforward and legitimate. Says Margie Gray: “I want answers. I want to know what happened that day. It&#8217;s the worst. It is horrific. And to know this went down at the hands of people you&#8217;re supposed to trust” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is Known</p>
<p>The day Myles Gray would be killed by police begins routinely enough. On a hot August day, the young greenery supplier was on a regular run of deliveries to flower wholesales in the area around Boundary Road and Marine Drive in Burnaby. Sometime around 2 pm, Gray wandered away from a loading bay and walked across a small overpass above Boundary Road, a dividing line between Burnaby and Vancouver. Coming down the overpass he found himself on the 3600 block of South East Marine Drive in Vancouver. A lover of the outdoors Myles Gray often went for walks during breaks in his delivery schedule. According to ahis father he left his keys, backpack, and identification inside the delivery van and headed off in the direction of a nearby park (Olivier 2016). Based on a map of the area it is believed that Myles Gray was heading toward Everett Crowley Park on the Vancouver side of Boundary Road. A worker at the florist supply store where Gray made his delivery saw him leaving with his headphones on. They waved at each other (Olivier 2016). According to his father: “There is a little park up there. He did the loop and was heading back. And I guess he saw this lady watering her grass” (quoted in Olivier 2016). It would prove to be a fatal encounter.</p>
<p>According to a neighborhood witness, Gray and a local woman ended up in an argument as she watered her garden under conditions of drought restrictions. At the time of the encounter, Metro Vancouver was under a Stage 3 restriction on water use and this included a complete ban on watering of lawns (Olivier 2016).</p>
<p>While it might not seem at all out of the ordinary for a greenery worker to be concerned about water usage on a lawn during a drought, for some reason police were called in this case. That fact raises real concerns about social disconnection, authoritarianism, and snitch tendencies within a fear culture, but these questions cannot be answered here.</p>
<p>What is clear is that 911 was called by the woman’s son and police responded (though again it might be asked why police treated an argument over lawn watering as a priority incident or why the person arguing against lawn watering during a drought was viewed as a perpetrator).</p>
<p>The woman involved has told reporters that she did indeed contact police after a verbal exchange with a man over her use of her water hose during a watering ban. She insists that she had never intended for anything bad to happen to him. It all began with a painful banality. She simply wanted the young man to go away (which it seems he was going to do on his own anyway). Upon finding out that the man had died through his encounter with police she says she was devastated (Olivier 2016). She says now: “I cried. Now when I talk about it, I get really angry” (quoted in Olivier 2016).</p>
<p>Upon encountering Gray the Vancouver police officers chase their presumed target across a Boundary Road overpass into Burnaby. Having cornered Gray in a residential yard police deploy the Orwellian named “chemical agents” and then “physical force” supposedly in an effort to restrain him. A short time after the encounter in the yard, and still an apparently short time after police first engaged him Gray was pronounced dead. It is also known that Myles Gray’s injuries were so severe that the funeral home suggested there not be an open casket funeral.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit filed in BC Supreme Court, Gray was “alone, unarmed, dressed in shorts and not engaged in any criminal activity during his interactions with the seven officers” (quoted in Rankin 2016). He was killed in the secluded backyard of a house in the 8300 block of Joffre Avenue. This was a mere 10 minute walk from where the original complaint had been made to police (Olivier 2016).</p>
<p>Immediately after Myles Gray was killed his father Mark visited the backyard where his son was killed by police. The yard on Joffre Avenue backs into a steep ravine filled with blackberry bushes (Olivier 2016). The father believes his son was at that point cornered with nowhere to go. This raises further questions about why police could not have engaged him more cautiously and communicatively. Why did they quickly move to force? He could have posed no harm to the general public or bystanders. He could not have gotten away. Mark Gray says that when he visited the yard there were still signs of the struggle. He saw patches of blood, torn up grass, and a destroyed rhododendron bush (Olivier 2016). The thought of what happened is unbearable:</p>
<p>“I can’t get past what happened — I can’t move on. I just feel bad that I wasn’t there to help him. I just wish I was there to help him. I would have in a second died for my son. I still would love to be dead and he still been alive. The thought of him, thinking how he suffered…” (quoted in Olivier 2016)</p>
<p>According to a police news release issued after the killing, one of the few communications from any state authorities in this case, Vancouver police reported that their members responded to a call of a distraught man causing a disturbance. The police account reads in part:</p>
<p>“He [Gary] became agitated and additional officers were called to the scene. Attempts to subdue the man with chemical agents were unsuccessful. A physical altercation ensued, resulting in injuries to the man and six officers. Paramedics were called to attend to the man. He died at the scene.” (quoted in Rankin 2016)</p>
<p>None of this, including the timelines involved (when police were sent, when reinforcements were sent or arrived, when chemical agents were applied, what the altercation consisted of) has been confirmed by independent sources. No specific details on any of this have been provided publicly in any way.</p>
<p>Even more the lawsuit suggests interference by police with the investigation by the Independent Investigations Office in British Columbia, the unit charged with investigating cases in which civilians are injured or killed by police. The lawsuit alleges that “the police unlawfully impeded the investigation … by the Independent Investigations Office by failing to immediately notify the IIO of the killing” (quoted in Rankin 2016). Myles Gray’s parents allege that during the delay, “officers failed to preserve evidence” and “conferred among themselves” (quoted in Rankin 2016). These claims are similar to the case of police involved in the killing of Robert Dziekanski in which the officers responsible were found to have colluded in crafting their explanation of what happened (before evidence in a citizen video showed what really occurred). Ironically perhaps it was the inquiry into the Dziekanski killing that led to the formation of the provincial police oversight body in British Columbia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds of Silence: The Authorities (Do Not) Respond</p>
<p>Another thing that is known is that for six months authorities have remained silent on the cause or he conditions surrounding Myles Gray’s death. The blue wall of silence remains solidly in place in this case. The Vancouver Police Department only offer this: “It wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate for the VPD to comment on an ongoing IIO investigation or a pending civil process” (quoted in Rankin). For its part the BC Coroners Service claims that it cannot comment while the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) investigates the case. At the same time the IIO, through spokesperson Marten Youssef insists: “Our investigation in this critical incident is ongoing. We are currently waiting on third party reports” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>Incredibly, and this is a situation we have discussed previously in some detail, one of the main reasons put forward by the IIO for the ongoing delays in its investigations is the fact that police in British Columbia are harming and killing so many people over the last few years. As Youseff claims:</p>
<p>“The timeliness of our investigations has suffered recently, in large part, as the result of a rash of officer-involved shootings and police-involved fatalities throughout the province that began in September of 2014 and continued for the better part of a year (a total of 20 shootings and fatalities in a period of 12 months).” (quoted in Rankin 2016)</p>
<p>One might ask whether the delays in the face of growing police violence is related to the training hat IIO investigators receive from the Justice Institute of British Columbia, the training academy staffed by and geared toward police officers. One might also ask why provincial resources are not forthcoming given the apparent need to step up investigations of officers through the IIO?</p>
<p>In the face of this terrible situation the Gray family asks for de-escalation training to be improved within the Vancouver Police Department. Their wish is that changes will come, in part through the impetus of their lawsuit, so that their son’s death will not have been in vain.</p>
<p>Gray’s parents knew him as someone who was gentle and walked away from fights. If he was involved in some sort of difficulty on August 13 it was not in character. In fact there is still no evidence that suggests Myles Gray was either in a vulnerable state or suffering from some sort of mental health crisis (apart from any stress caused by being chased and attacked by police of course)a psychotic break. Neither is there any evidence to suggest that he was under the influence of any intoxicants. On the morning he died he was reported to be happy and in normal spirits according to his workers. While granting that something could have upset him later, though there is no evidence for this, the family and colleagues also note that it need not have led to his death: “Maybe he was having an emotional meltdown. He was probably in a vulnerable state. They pursued him for sure. What he needed probably was some compassion” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>And compassion is certainly what Myles Gray did not receive. The list of people in need of compassion who instead encounter police is a growing one in the Canadian context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comply or Die</p>
<p>As in numerous other cases in which several police encounter someone who is spatially contained with nowhere to go, and no way to harm bystanders, there are serious questions why police so quickly resort to lethal force. The mindset and practice of the police assert a framework in which the only option is “comply or die.” A purely authoritarian assertion. Recommendations have long been made about better training, including de-escalation training. Others have raised the possibility of mental health or health care professionals responding instead of or along with police.</p>
<p>These are questions that weigh on Mark Gray. He suggests: “They should definitely have better training. If there&#8217;s seven of them, one should have said, ‘Hey, let&#8217;s back off’ and treat this a little differently in how it went down. It could have gone down a lot differently. And Myles could have been alive today” (quoted in Rankin 2016).</p>
<p>This sentiment is echoed by Margie Gray. In her words:</p>
<p>“There needs to be a change in the way they deal with people. They need more training in their de-escalation skills. They just need more training, period … no one should have to live through what we’ve been living through. It’s a living hell. I do not want any family to ever have to go through what we’ve been going through.” (quoted in Rankin 2016)</p>
<p>She further adds: “Even getting the details are not going to bring my son back. But in going forward, hopefully there is going to be change. This cannot happen to anybody else. Because I feel like if this happened to our family, it can literally happen to anyone’s family” (quoted in Olivier 2016). Given the histories of police killings of civilians in Canada there is little reason for optimism that charges will be laid against any of the officers involved.</p>
<p>And no family should have to go through any of this. In too many cases police are deployed in cases for which they are neither prepared nor equipped. At the same time they interact in those situations, even where the behavior that brought the call is minor, on an absolutist basis pursuing the authoritarian and violent lines that have been ingrained in them (and which are the basis of their operations). With no leeway, or inclination, to soften the approach or act in a more nuanced way. Of course, real care, service, and protection of regular humans in need has never been the purpose or role of police in state capitalist contexts (or any other context for that matter).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion: Why Call the Cops Anyway?</p>
<p>From another, more critical, perspective one might question why state authorities are deployed in such circumstances at all. Clearly arguments over lawn care, and civic responsibilities during water shortages, should not result in calls to the state or to the deployment of armed forces. Larger questions remain about sociality and social engagement in anomic, detached, privatized societies. One of the problems with policing is that it breeds reliance or dependence on policing. People do not resolve social differences, even minor ones, through discussion or agreement to disagree, Instead the initial, almost reflexive, response is to call the cops. And unfortunately the cops are all too willing to oblige (it builds public relations and helps maintain or increase budgets after all). So-called “tough on crime” or broken windows approaches I the context of broader socio-political cultures of fear and panic only make things worse.</p>
<p>The sociologist Emile Durkheim suggested that in stratified societies with a broad division of labor, as in advanced capitalist modernity, are subject to conditions of anomie or a breakdown of shared norms, values, and beliefs (the conscience collective). Such societies are marked by a lack of trust among people and a tendency toward dependence on authorities. Under these conditions, and manipulable fear that accompanies them, people turn too readily to authorities and are too accepting of the actions taken by authorities however egregious they might be. Thus police are able to kill and get away with killing while remaining silent or worse obstructionist or disassembling in the face of questions from the loved ones of those whose lives have been taken.</p>
<p>As Mark Gray puts it: “I want my son back, but that’s never going to happen. It could be (that) other people will have their son killed, and it’s just not right the way they treat people. It’s just not right” (quoted in Ranking 2016).</p>

<p>This project has documented the bogus nature of “suicide by cop” as a means to excuse police killings of civilians. It is a form of copaganda used as a legitimation tool by so-called oversight agencies (none of which are autonomous and independent from police with powers of compulsion) and state inquests to justify police killings of civilians to an anxious and critical public. The reasons for the bogus nature of this claim are numerous and have been laid out here previously. The claim is only applied after the fact in diverse situations and ignores the fact that unlike in other suicides the victim is killed, not by their own actions, but by the conscious decision of someone who chooses to use lethal force rather choosing not to kill.</p>
<p>Once again this phony “finding” has been used to legitimate the lethal actions of a killer cop. The killing of 20-year-old Victoria youth Rhett Mutch by police constable John Musicco has been declared a suicide by a coroner’s inquest in findings announced May 19, 2017. Incredibly the inquest report offered no reasons for why the jury classified the killing as a suicide. Constable Musicco had already been cleared by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the body that examines cases of police violence against civilians in British Columbia.</p>
<p>Musicco shot Mutch in the neck killing him  on November 1, 2014. At the time he was shot the young man was alone in the basement of his mother’s house and posed no threat to his mother (who was safely outside the house) or to the general public.</p>
<p>The report even noted in detail an exchange between Marney Mutch, the victim’s mother, and police officers in which she told them that her son would not hurt anyone. She also informed them that drawn guns would only frighten her distraught son further. She told the inquest that one of the officers held a gun that looked like “a bazooka.” This is another problem of &#8220;suicide by cop&#8221; excuses. They ignore the role of police actions in changing victim&#8217;s interactions. In her view, as stated in the report: “This is really overkill.” She wanted to stay in the house with her son but officers refused her request.</p>

<p>More than two years ago a Victoria mother’s plea for help for her son ended with police taking the young man’s life. Rhett Mutch was shot and killed inside his mom’s home by Constable John Musicco. Mutch posed no threat to the public. In a 911 call made by Marney Mutch she told the operator that her son would not do anything to physically hurt her. While Musicco was, predictably, cleared of any wrongdoing in killing Rhett Mutch by the provincial investigation unit for British Columbia, a coroner’s inquest is looking into the killing.</p>
<p>Rhett Mutch was killed by Constable Musicco on November 1, 2014. Marney Mutch had called 911 after her son broke into the basement of her home on Dallas Road in Victoria. Several police officers entered the home, killing Mutch within only minutes of their arrival.</p>
<p>The inquest which started May 15, 2017 has focused on misinformation apparently passed from the 911 operator to police. In the 911 call, which was played for the coroner’s jury, Marney Mutch said that her son had a knife, but would not use it to hurt her and further told the operator that he was holding it by his stomach. In the dispatch audio, a police dispatcher is heard saying that Rhett Mutch was holding the knife to his throat.</p>
<p>Victoria Police Sergeant Gregory Holmes,  the supervisor the day of the incident testified to the jury on Monday, May 15 but could not answer why police responded with force if Marney Mutch was not in danger and simply wanted help for her son. It is not clear either why police went after Rhett Mutch who was by then alone in the house, his mother having left safely when police arrived.</p>

<p>The secrecy that surrounds information about officers involved in the deaths of civilians, and the fact that officers who kill people are not readily named in the Canadian context, extends to information about the circumstances of police killings of civilians.</p>
<p>Details about police killings of civilians typically only emerge in cases in which charges are brought and which end up in court, since court proceedings are public in Canada, or in certain cases that are reviewed by provincial oversight bodies, where they exist, or in coroners’ inquiries. In cases in which other police forces investigate their fellow police information is not forthcoming. Even in cases that are reviewed by oversight agencies or coroners’ inquiries details can be obscure or conflicting. Yet having some access to witness accounts or evidence and cross examination from lawyers of victims’ families can provide some of the only opportunities for the public to have any insights into the horrible situations faced by victims in their final moments or in events that would lead to their deaths subsequently.</p>
<p>The transcripts of responses to investigators offer some too little seen insights into police encounters with people experiencing mental health crises and show, in a startling and awful way, how quickly police can escalate situations and how single minded (and unforgiving) they are in seeking compliance from people who are clearly distraught, even confused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubling Encounters: The Police Killing of Rhett Mutch</p>
<p>Details released at the conclusion of an Independent Investigations Office (IIO) investigation into the shooting and killing of 20-year-old Rhett Mutch by a Vitoria Police Department officer show the deeply disturbing actions undertaken by police in a situation in which a young man experiencing mental health issues is confronted by officers set on achieving compliance. The following accounts are from that IIO report as reported in Petrescu (2016).</p>
<p>Rhett Mutch was shot and killed by police on the morning of November 1, 2014, in his mother’s home. She had called 911 at 10:51 AM after her son had broken into her home. The two had been texting for some time before the son entered his mother’s house. At the time he was under a court order not to contact her or visit her house. Marney Mutch informed the 911 dispatcher of this. In the kitchen Rhett Mutch took a steak knife with a serrated edge and held it to his stomach (Petrescu 2016).</p>
<p>Lowering the knife Rhett Mutch moved into the living room and sat down on a couch. The 911 dispatcher informed Marney Mutch that police had arrived and told her to leave the house. She refused to leave her son and informed that operator that he was now pointing the knife at the floor and she believed that her son would not harm her (Petrescu 2016).</p>
<p>Within four minutes of the initial call to 911 two Victoria police officers arrived at Marney Mutch’s house. Others were dispatched and on their way. The situation was described by dispatcher to officers as involving a man with a knife to his throat. A supervisor reportedly suggested the officers should “try and probe, use cover, initiate dialogue” (Petrescu 2016). It seems that the officer did not take this approach in engaging Rhett Mutch.</p>
<p>When Marney Mutch opened the door to meet police she was startled to see the officers approaching her front door with a large gun. She asked: “Whoa. What is that for?” (quoted in Petrescu 2016). The ensuing conversation unfolded as follows according to the investigation report.</p>
<p>The officer upon entering responded: “He’s armed.”</p>
<p>Mutch clarified: “He’s got a kitchen knife and he’s not going to hurt anybody with it.”</p>
<p>The officer asserted their need to protect her and informed her that they had a beanbag gun.</p>
<p>Mutch expressed that she did not fear her son: “He’s not going to hurt me. He’s not going to hurt anybody.”</p>
<p>Speaking of the gun wielded by police Marney Mutch further explained to investigators: “So like, I wanted him to go away with it. He didn’t. It was frightening. It was only going to scare the hell out of him … He had tears in his eyes.”</p>
<p>The officer insisted that she not stay in the house. Two more officers entered the house as Marney Mutch exited. She noticed one of the officers carrying a weapon that she described as looking like a bazooka. She again expressed her concerns: “This is really overkill.” Instead of taking her advice or consulting her further Marney Mutch was made to sit inside a police car away from her son.</p>
<p>There was a sense that the number of officers in his immediate space frightened or agitated Mutch. Officers suggested a change in his demeanor at their presence. A neighbor is recorded in the report saying he heard police repeatedly shouting at the young man and this could be heard from outside the house.</p>
<p>For their part the officers involved told investigators that they were not sure if anyone else was in the house at the time of the encounter. They suggested this ratcheted up their sense of urgency and concern that someone else could be harmed. The presence or not of others, however, could have been determined by asking Marney Mutch. In any event, the IIO noted that this was a serious communication failure by the officers involved.</p>
<p>At 11:02 AM an officer inside the house with a beanbag gun fired at Mutch hitting him in the thigh but apparently not knocking him down (Petrescu 2016). Officers stated that they felt confined with too little room to move quickly or to retreat. This was another serious failing of the police response. Another officer fired hitting Mutch in the neck causing the victim to bleed severely. Paramedics would arrive five minutes later but there were no signs of life and Rhett Mutch was pronounced dead at 11:29 AM.</p>
<p>The IIO cleared the police officer who killed Mutch. Use of force was declared to be justified, the typical ruling from oversight bodies in Canada. In its statement the office concluded:</p>
<p>“There is no evidence to support that the involved officers had any malice against, or motivation to do harm to, the affected person or use any force against him other than what was reasonably necessary to take him into lawful custody” (quoted in Petrescu 2016)</p>
<p>The IIO also concluded that the Victoria Police Department was not criminally negligent in their fateful decision to confront Rhett Mutch rather than withdrawing from the house to a safer barricade position from which they, or a mental healthcare person, could negotiate.</p>
<p>Once again concerns were raised about the timeframe of the IIO investigation. It took a rather tardy 19 months to complete, an issue that IIO critics note has become standard for the unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Serious Questions</p>
<p>IIO Chair Marten Youseff reported that the events surrounding the killing of Rhett Mutch raised serious questions for officers regarding the actions of the Victoria Police Department. According to the report: “Unfortunately, significant communication failures led to different perspectives amongst different officers as to the need to immediately confront the affected person” (quoted in Petrescu 2016). Yet there is no explanation for the confusion on this given that Marney Mutch had spoken of the lack of immediate (or looming) threat both to the 911 dispatcher and to the officers at the scene. And police knew that she was inside a police vehicle and thus facing no threat at all at the time police entered the house.</p>
<p>The IIO report concludes: “Given the totality of the circumstances, there are significant questions that need to be asked as to why the officers were inside the residence at all, at the moment the shots were fired” (quoted in Lupick 2016).</p>
<p>Of particular concern for investigators was the fact that the officers involved did not know who was in the house when they entered. This despite the obvious, acknowledged, presence of the mother and the opportunity to speak with her (as at least one officer did). The officer who shot Mutch claimed that he would have proceeded differently, setting up an armed barricade and not entering the house, if he had been aware that no one else was inside or that Mutch was suicidal (Petrescu 2016). The number of officers in a tight space was said to limit their options. Neither pepper spray nor baton were deemed viable in that context.</p>
<p>Despite the findings of the investigation and the description of what happened by Marney Mutch the Victoria Police Department continued to portray officers as trying to de-escalate the situation. In a statement released following the IIO report, Victoria police chief Del Manak stated:</p>
<p>“In addition to the grief and sorrow this has caused the family, this incident has had a profound effect on the officers who were involved. Despite their training, experience, the action plan they developed for this dynamic situation, and their attempts to de-escalate the situation, this incident ended in tragedy.” (quoted in Petrescu 2016)</p>
<p>Yet this was a tragedy that need not have occurred.</p>
<p>Victoria police were presented with the IIO report and insisted they will work with the Office of the Police Complaint Commissioner to examine departmental protocols. In a statement they claim: “we remain committed to continual assessment of our practices. This is especially important given the steadily increasing number of calls from the public requesting that our officers attend to people experiencing some form of crisis” (quoted in Petrescu 2016). Yet in case after case in the Canadian context, regardless of jurisdiction police are responding to people experiencing crisis with a “comply or die” focus, aggression, violence, and ultimately lethal force.</p>
<p>And when police act in these encounters they tend to act aggressively and quickly with no sense of attempts at de-escalation or communication. According to the IIO report, only between five and six minutes passed between the time at which Victoria police officers made contact with Mutch and the discharge of a firearm. As Lupick notes, that is significantly longer than is often the case in other police shootings in British Columbia. Lupick notes that there is a pattern in fatal encounters involving police and civilians in the province. It is, in fact, common for police to have fired their weapons within the first few minutes of contact with someone experiencing mental health issues or personal crisis, often discharging weapons within the first 60 seconds of contact (Lupick 2016). Clearly this shows that virtually no efforts are made a de-escalation or discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Following the release of the IIO investigation report Marney Mutch told reporters that in her view it was the actions of police and their hard response that led to an intensification of her son’s behavior. In particular she noted the presence of large, ominous looking, weapons, the number of officers confronting her son, five, and the fact that they cornered her son in a single room. In her view: “They created the situation that led to my son being shot” (quoted in Petrescu 2016).</p>
<p>She believes that her son Rhett did not want to die and would not have killed himself and she is confident that she was never in danger from her son. In her words: “There was nothing aggressive about him” (quoted in Petrescu 2016). In the view of Marney Mutch, and indeed of many commentators and critics, it is the wrong approach to aggressively confront someone, particularly with weapons, experiencing a mental health crisis (Petrescu 2016). She has added her voice to the call from others for improved training for police in dealing with people experiencing mental health emergencies.</p>

<p>British Columbia RCMP shot and killed a man who has been identified by family members as Kyaw Din (54) at a Maple Ridge home on August 11, 2019. The killing took place at a home in the area of Colemore Street and 124 Avenue.</p>
<p>Family members have spoken publicly to say that the victim had a history of mental illness and had been between hospital and home over a period of some time. His brother Thant Din reports that Kyaw Din had forgotten or refused to take his medication the Sunday he was killed. According to Din: “In the past, my sister would call police, and police would come and take him to hospital. So today my sister called police, but he didn’t want to go” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Din reports that his brother had barricaded himself in his room and refused to leave when police arrived. He says that his sister asked that he and other siblings come to come to Maple Ridge from Coquitlam to help translate between their brother and police (Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Din recalls the frustration of conversations with police. In his words: “My sister told police, ‘Don’t do anything, they’re 15 minutes away, they’re on their way.’ When we show up, there’s police tape and we can’t go inside” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>He expresses his horror over police actions toward his brother: “They shot him. They shot him point blank. They unnecessarily killed someone” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Kyaw Din’s sister Yin Yin reports that she was told by police to wait outside the home. She then heard three shots. Incredibly, three officers came outside of the home “about an hour later,” but left the scene before she could talk with them (Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>She reports publicly her conversation with police: “They asked me if my brother has a gun. He doesn’t have a gun. He doesn’t have a knife. He’s just in the room and I told the police he has a glass bottle that he might throw at you. I don’t want you to get hurt and I don&#8217;t want the police to shoot my brother” (quoted in Holliday 2019).</p>
<p>She insists that police deceived her and the family: “They lied to me. They promised me, ‘we would never shoot your brother, we deal with this all the time,’ and they shot him” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>She is left only to ponder, in sorrow: “For no reason, they shot him. Can you imagine? Brother was doing housework in the morning and now he is dead” (quoted in Holliday 2019)</p>
<p>Thant Din Thant tells reporters that his brother was sometimes loud and confrontational when not taking his medicine, but he never saw Kyaw Din become violent. According to Thant Din: “He never hit anybody. He might be screaming and yelling, but he never hit anybody” (quoted in Holliday 2019).</p>
<p>Thant Din is angry and wants to see police held accountable for what happened. As he puts it, poignantly: “We’re heartbroken. To have a mentally ill person shot in his own home? It’s terrible” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>It has been reported by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the unit that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, that police officers also used a taser on the victim.</p>
<p>Police across Canada kill numerous people experiencing mental health issues every. Cops should not be responding to people in mental health crisis and resources should be moved from police to mental health and health care supports and resources.</p>

<p>Everett Patrick (42), a member of the Lake Babine First Nation, has died after being taken into custody by Prince George RCMP on April 12, 2020. Patrick had been hospitalized after going into “medical distress” while being arrested by RCMP. He was taken off life support on April 17 and died on April 20.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office of British Columbia (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating Patrick’s death. They report that the RCMP used a dog team to track Patrick down after allegedly responding to an alarm at a private business. They also say that Patrick was taken to hospital twice on the day he was arrested, first to be treated for what have been described as “minor wounds.” The nature of these wounds has not been confirmed publicly but it has been said that they were bites from the police dogs.</p>
<p>The IIO report that hours after being returned to the RCMP detachment from the hospital, Patrick “went into medical distress and was transported to hospital where he was found to be suffering from serious injury.” Miranda Thomas, Patrick’s sister, says that the family has been told that “he was having a seizure in the jail cell” (quoted in Bellrichard 2020).</p>
<p>Thomas says that doctors told the family that a CT scan showed that Patrick suffered “bleeding in his brain requiring emergency surgery and that he wasn&#8217;t expected to survive” (quoted in Bellrichard 2020).</p>
<p>The family has serious questions about what happened to Patrick while he was in RCMP custody and what caused him to be taken to the hospital for a second time the same day (Bellrichard 2020).</p>

<p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Canada have their origins as a colonial military force. Their history is one of settlerism and class domination on an ongoing basis. They continue in the present to police and regulate and repress Indigenous communities through targeted violence. This must be remembered in any case of RCMP contact with Indigenous people and communities in Canada.</p>
<p>Alberta RCMP shot and killed Ralph Stephens, 27, on the Stoney Nakoda First Nation near Morley on Saturday, January 7, 2017. Stephens died in hospital about and hour after being shot. Police claim they were on the reserve to execute a warrant for first-degree murder charges related to the death of Lorenzo “Billy” Bearspaw, also 27, whose body was found on the reserve on January 6 after he was reported missing on January 3 by a family member. The other men pursued by RCMP, John Stephens, 29, and Deangelo Powderface, 22, have both been taken into custody by the force. John Stephens was arrested directly prior to the killing of Ralph Stephens. Major Crimes with assistance from the RCMP Emergency Response Team were involved.</p>
<p>No one has said why police opened fire on the victim. Nothing has been reported to suggest he confronted or attacked police. Police have only said that Ralph Stephens “engaged police” but this has not been corroborated by any independent sources or witnesses. Several people were said to be in the residence at which Stephens was killed when the shooting happened.</p>
<p>The dangerous nature of this police action and the prospect it will stoke justified anger toward RCMP are clear. Police seem concerned with dampening any response. Chief Superintendent Tony Hamori, the officer in charge of Southern Alberta made an appeal with no note of accountability or reasons for adherence: “I also urge calm in the community while the investigations take place” (quoted by Anderson 2017).</p>
<p>Community members describe a chaotic scene after police arrived on the scene. According to Gerald Powderface, a relative of Ralph Stephens: “My family told me it happened so quick, even my cousin was asking them ‘Have you shot my boy?’ They didn’t even answer him, they just dragged him out of the house without no shoes and they&#8217;re throwing people out of the house left and right. They didn’t even answer his question, ‘Have you shot my boy? What happened, what’s going on here?’” (quoted in Anderson 2017).</p>
<p>The community has come to the family’s care and support. According to Gerald Powderface: We have a community here that support each other on every matter, especially a matter like that. They all come to the house. There was a lot of people there last night when I left” (quoted in Anderson 2017).</p>
<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating the RCMP actions in killing Ralph Stephens. RCMP continue to maintain an active presence on the reserve since the shooting.</p>
<p>Whatever one might think about this particular case the fact remains that an historic settler colonial force built on dispossession, expropriation, and genocide continues to police Indigenous communities across Canada.</p>

<p>Alberta RCMP shot and killed 21-year-old Abderrahmane (Adam) Bettahar outside Edmonton following a multi-vehicle chase on the evening of March 29, 2018. Bettahar was a suspect in the death of 22-year-old Nadia El-Dib on March 25 in Calgary. No cause of death or motive in the death of El-Dib has been released publicly.</p>
<p>According to the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians, police identified Bettahar’s vehicle in Evansburg, Alberta, around 5:15 PM on Thursday, March 29. RCMP from various areas, Evansburg, Stony Plain, Spruce Grove, Edson, and Drayton Valley, chased the vehicle back and forth on Highway 16 between Evansburg and Entwistle. The driver apparently managed to avoid several spike belts deployed by the RCMP before the vehicle’s tires were deflated near Nojack, Alberta, about 100 kilometres west of Edmonton.</p>
<p>An interaction, said by ASIRT to be a shootout, resulted in the death of Bettahar. A cop was injured with non-life-threatening injuries, the source of which has not been confirmed. One witness has reported hearing 30 to 40 gunshots. Another reported hearing about 20 gunshots.</p>

<p>Family members have identified 34-year-old Robin Fiddler of Waterhen Lake First Nation, in northern Saskatchewan, as the woman shot and killed by a Calgary police officer on June 26, 2019. She was shot twice by the killer cop. Fiddler was a trades worker in construction.</p>

“When we were both younger, I just took her under my wing and that was that. She would come live with me when she had the opportunity. I’ve always had an open door for her. Robin was a beautiful soul, she deserved to live.”</p>
<p>Calgary police Chief Mark Neufeld has said that the officer who killed Fiddler was wearing a police-issued, body-worn camera at the time of the killing. No video has been released publicly. Robin Fiddler’s killing is at least the third police-involved death in Calgary in 2019.</p>
<p>The family reports that they are returning Robin Fiddler’s body to Saskatchewan so that the family can lay her to rest and start a traditional healing journey (Laing 2019).</p>

<p>There are many unanswered questions about the role Saskatoon police played in the death of 21-year-old Jordan Lafond of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation. An inquest into the death that was scheduled to take begin March 5, 2018, and which family hoped would provide some answers, has now been postponed until June 25.</p>
<p>The questions surrounding Lafond’s death are more pressing given that police initially suggested the injuries that led to Lafond’s death were inflicted in a vehicular crash and did not report that an officer used his knee to subdue the young man when he was handcuffed.</p>
<p>It has been reported publicly that Jordan Lafond died after the stolen truck he was a passenger in crashed into a fence on the outskirts of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in the early morning hours of October 23, 2016. Lafond was taken into custody and later died in hospital. Police have not been forthcoming on their role in Lafond’s death and what they did to him during the arrest.</p>
<p>A six-person jury, five women and one-man, was selected on Monday. Four of the jurors are Indigenous. Three were selected from a special jury pool of Indigenous people and one who self-identified. The request for Indigenous jurors can be made at inquests but not for criminal trials, an issue that has received great attention following the recent not guilty verdicts in the killings of Indigenous youth Colten Boushie and Tina Fontaine. The inquest is strictly a fact finding exercise and cannot assign blame or lead to charges being laid.</p>
<p>Grace Lafond-Barr, Jordan’s grandmother expressed the family’s grief: “Emotions have been up and down. A lot of tears, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness. Because we don’t know what happened to Jordan” (quoted in Hamilton 2018). She noted that police were not honest in reporting their actions during Jordan Lafond’s arrest. In her words: “We didn’t hear the truth when we were told of Jordan’s injuries. It would be nice to know what happened to him” (quoted in Hamilton 2018).</p>
<p>Police changed their story about what happened a few weeks after Lafond died. They had initially claimed that Lafond was found underneath a tire of the truck that crashed and said at that time that he died of injuries resulting from that crash. Then-police Chief Clive Weighill alleged that officers believed Lafond was resisting arrest and acknowledged that an officer used his knee to subdue Lafond and that he was handcuffed. Police have not admitted what part that might have played in the death.</p>
<p>Police even had to downgrade the initial charge of dangerous driving causing death laid against the driver of the stolen truck. Said the Crown prosecutor at the time: “We weren’t in a position to prove that the accident—or the collision, in this case—caused the death” (quoted in Hamilton 2018).</p>
<p>Saskatoon Police Service released a statement on March 5 saying that  they had carried out an internal investigation into Lafond’s death but would not release any details or results. There is no police oversight body, independent or otherwise, in Saskatchewan. The officer responsible is still on regular duties.</p>
<p>Jordan Lafond was a new father and worked at a roofing company to support her. Said Lafond-Barr: “Yes maybe he was in a stolen vehicle. But that doesn’t mean you should end his life over it. That’s what I said. I would like to bring some humanity to this (quoted in Hamilton 2018).</p>
<p>Anyone following events in Saskatchewan will note that young Indigenous men have been killed in that province for as little as stepping foot on a farm claimed by a white settler, with the settler farmer getting off despite admitting to the killing. So being killed by police for being in a stolen vehicle would not be unlikely in that context. And the officer involved will likely not even be charged. Jordan Lafond was the same age as Colten Boushie.</p>

<p>Jordan Bruce Lafond, a 21-year-old father of a small child, died one day after being taken into custody by Saskatoon police following a violent arrest on October 23, 2016. Several weeks later serious questions remain unanswered regarding the role of police violence in causing the young man’s death.</p>
<p>Jordan Lafond’s mother, Charmaine Dreaver is seeking answers to those questions in the face of general silence from Saskatoon police. In her words: “I just want and need the truth to be told,” (quoted in Markewich 2016). Family members have turned to the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations special investigations unit and the Chief of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation to discuss possible steps forward.</p>
<p>Jordan Lafond was the passenger in a vehicle that crashed while being chased by police. The driver sustained minimal injuries and ran from the scene. He was later found and charged. Lafond was supposedly found beneath the rear of the vehicle. Police have claimed he was thrown from the vehicle during the crash and was not run over by any vehicle. .</p>
<p>Charmaine Dreaver notes her son showed real physical trauma. In her words: “My son was banged up pretty bad. His body showed signs of a lot of damage” (quoted in Markewich 2016). She has reported being left with a sense of unease and questioning since learning about her son’s injuries. This sense grew upon hearing that the other man in the vehicle who fled was not nearly as badly injured (Markewich 2016). As she recalls: “[That] made me feel that, OK, there’s something more to this” (quoted in Markewich 2016). Police have said that the injuries, including bruising and head trauma were caused by the collision (Markewich 2016). She asked immediately for an autopsy to be undertaken to receive some answers and clarification. She relates: “I was angered and I was so hurt because my son went through so much pain” (quoted in Markewich 2016).</p>
<p>Police have provided the questionable and apparently contradictory explanation that the supposedly fatally injured Lafond resisted arrest to such an extent that an officer felt compelled to use a knee to subdue him. This seems implausible given the supposed degree of injuries police suggest were sustained from the crash alone.</p>
<p>Dreaver finds the explanation questionable as well. She notes: “I almost felt that I was lied to, really, because I didn’t know. I wasn’t told about [it]” (quoted in Markewich 2016).</p>
<p>The autopsy was completed Wednesday, November 2 but results have not been released. Saskatoon Police Chief Clive Weighill has not given the public a timeline for release of the autopsy findings.</p>

<p>The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) is calling for an independent investigation after the killing of Geoff Morris (41) by Regina Police Service officers on May 4, 2019. In a news release, FSIN Vice Chief Dutch Lerat noted that,</p>
<p>“We have seen officers investigating their fellow officers and we all know how those investigations turn out. We are calling on the Regina Police Service to allow for an outside and independent oversight body to be a part of this investigation. We have been calling for this for years and these senseless police-related deaths keep happening.”</p>
<p>Morris was shot and killed by Regina police, during what cops say was a hostage situation. There are reasons to be skeptical about this given the lack of public information around another recent alleged hostage-taking in which two people were killed by RCMP in Surrey, British Columbia in March 2019. In that case it was later revealed that police had shot and killed both people, including the alleged hostage Nona McEwan. Notably, Regina Police chief Evan Bray would not say whether an alleged hostage was still being held when the shooting occurred.</p>
<p>Indeed, the police justification of events is being contradicted by Morris’ fiancé, Jasmine Brass, who says she was present when Morris was killed. In her words: “Honestly it wasn’t necessary for them to kill him, they could’ve just tased him” (quoted in Melnychuck 2019). She reports that Morris had been struggling with mental health issues and that she and her sister were with Morris trying to help him the morning he was killed by police.</p>
<p>Brass also reports that he became more agitated when police arrived, a not uncommon occurrence as the appearance of police typically heightens tensions and stress. She gives a chilling account, saying on facebook that she heard a “bang” and felt a splatter of blood at the moment of killing. Incredibly Brass reports that police shot Morris while she sat between his legs.</p>
<p>Morris was biological father to four children. He also took in six other children and raised them. One daughter, Tanisha Whiteman, remembers him as a good, loving man who struggled with anxiety issues. She asks why police acted so quickly to kill. In her words:</p>
<p>“That’s somebody’s father. That’s somebody’s son. That’s somebody’s brother, somebody’s nephew. He was loved by so many people. Why? Just like that, he’s gone. There could have been other ways that could have been handled. They didn’t have to take someone’s life away (quoted in Whitfield 2019a).</p>
<p>Heartbreaking words about the role played by police came from 12-year-old son Nakayoh Friday: “I want people to know that the people who were supposed to protect us aren’t protecting us. They are killing us. I don’t want other families to go through my pain” (quoted in Whitfield 2019b).</p>
<p>According to Regina Police chief Evan Bray, legislation requires that the Regina Police Service’s Major Crime unit investigates the shooting. Cops investigating cops. The officer involved in the shooting was a member of the patrol response remains on active duty.</p>
<p>Regina police claim that the killing of Morris is the first killing by an officer in the city since 1998. Police also claim that there have been four officer-involved shootings in the last 10 years, with none of those resulting in the death of the victim.</p>

<p>On June 19, 2017, Saskatoon police shot 22-year-old Austin Eaglechief. The young man then crashed the vehicle he was driving into another vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. An autopsy suggests the gunshot was not the cause of death but it does not speak to the part that being shot played in the fatal crash. A 33-year-old passenger was also injured in the crash. Critics of the police suggest that officers were too quick to shoot the young man. The Saskatoon police force has a history of racist treatment and violence against Indigenous people in the city and nearby locales.</p>

<p>The family of a man who died during an arrest by Winnipeg police has identified him as Randy Cochrane, a 30-year-old father of three. Family members are calling for answers into what happened during the arrest and why there appear to be discrepancies in what police reported and what doctors in the hospital emergency have said.</p>
<p>Randy Cochrane’s cousin Monica Murdock asks pointedly:</p>
<p>“My family’s devastated. We want to know what happened to him. Why did he die in cuffs? Why were they chasing him? Why are they saying he was bloody but the doctors we went and saw at the emergency room last night said that he had no injuries? (quoted in Grabish 2019)</p>
<p>Murdock reports that doctors at the Health Sciences Centre told her family on Sunday, after Cochrane died, that the young man had suffered a heart attack and had a high fever. She also reports that they told her there were no other injuries on his body. She says that doctors informed her that it was too late by the time Cochrane arrived at the hospital at 4:30 PM because he had been without a pulse for some time (Grabish 2019).</p>
<p>Murdock describes her cousin as “a fierce protector of his family” and she says “he was more like a brother to her” (2019). She relates fondly: “He always made sure we were protected. We were safe. The last time I saw him he came to my house and he gave me some money for my baby ‘cause my daughter’s in the hospital” (quoted in Grabish 2019).</p>
<p>Marjorie Cochrane raised Randy after adopting him. She remembers:</p>
<p>“He was really always close to his daughters. It’s hard. Taking it hard” (quoted in Grabish 2019).</p>
<p>She too has important questions for police: “What happened when they handcuffed him?” (quoted in Grabish 2019).</p>
<p>A witness, Will Couture, says Cochrane, rather than being a threat, appeared to be shouting for help while running from something or someone (2019). Couture reports that the man, kept repeating “help me, help me” (Grabish 2019). He then saw police chase Cochrane across the street.</p>
<p>Couture claims that the man looked “freaked out.” In his words: “Just scared. Just like terrified of something you know what I mean? It was like the devil was chasing him” (quoted in Grabish 2019).</p>
<p>If it was the police, he may be completely right in that.</p>

<p>Halifax Regional Police Special Constables Daniel Fraser and Cheryl Gardner have been charged with criminal negligence causing death after 41-year-old Corey Rogers was found dead in a police station cell in the early morning hours of June 16, 2016. Despite paramedics being called, Rogers could not be revived. Constables Fraser and Gardner were working as booking officers on the night of Rogers’s arrest and detention.</p>
<p>Corey Rogers death came only hours after the birth of his daughter. He had been arrested for public intoxication the previous evening outside of the IWK Health Centre.</p>
<p>The case was initially given to Nova Scotia’s Serious Incident Response Team (SIRT), which investigates cases of police harm to civilians in the province. SIRT referred the case to prosecutors in Manitoba because the Nova Scotia Public Prosecution Service apparently wished to avoid an appearance of conflict.</p>

<p>Edmundston Police (New Brunswick) shot and killed Chantel Moore, a 26-year-old Indigenous woman of Tlaoquiaht First Nation, near Tofino, so-called British Columbia, during a so-called wellness check early in the morning of June 4, 2020. The family has reported that the victim was shot five times by police. Edmundston Police Force Inspector Steve Robinson told reporters that he did not believe that the officer in question attempted to use any non-lethal force. Chantel Moore was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Chantel Moore’s grandmother, Nora Martin, is certain the killing is racist in nature. In her words: “When I first heard about it, that was my first thought: ‘This was racially motivated.’ We’ve been dealing with police brutality for a number of years. I know in my own family it’s been going on for a long time” (quoted in CTV News 2020).</p>
<p>The history of policing in Canada is one of racism and white supremacy at its core. Policing has played a central part in the dispossession, displacement, subjugation, control, killing, and genocide of Indigenous people and communities—has been central to the interlinking settler colonial capitalist projects. And policing continues to play a key part in maintaining those projects up to the present.</p>
<p>This is yet another, too common, case of police being the first sent out when people are believed to be in crisis or in need of a “wellness check.” Police should not be sent under these circumstances. They are not health care providers. Too often the outcome is police killing the person needing support or care. Police are not about wellness. Resources for health care, including mental health care, should be diverted away from police and used in community health care supports. Police budgets continue to grow as necessary health care services require more funding.</p>
<p>Police will be investigating police in this killing. Officers from Saint John will be part of the investigation as well as an as yet unnamed “independent agency” (which will in no way be independent given the involvement of police in the investigation).</p>

<p>Attachie Ashoona, a 38-year-old Inuit artist has been identified as the person killed by Nunavut RCMP on February 26, 2020 in Kinngait, Nunavut. This information has come out as an investigation into the RCMP by the Ottawa Police Service (OPS) has concluded that the killer cops should not be criminally charged.</p>
<p>This is clearly a case of police investigating police, with the predictable outcome. Two Ottawa police investigators from the homicide unit along with two forensic officers were deployed to Kinngait. They report interviewing five RCMP officers as well as 10 civilian witnesses.</p>
<p>The cop “investigation” of cops concluded that “the RCMP officer&#8217;s use of lethal force did not exceed the use of force necessary to control the situation” According to what police define as necessary, not the community.</p>
<p>The community has expressed frustration over the fact that this investigation has occurred with only minimal information made public. No other details of the police killing have been released to the community. In fact, the initial reports did not even say that someone had been killed, only that there was “an RCMP-related incident.” It has since come out that Attachie Ashoona was shot by an RCMP officer.</p>

MR_0,"In 1984, Kelly was convicted of the first-degree murder of his wife Jeannette Kelly by throwing her from the 17th floor balcony of The Palace Pier high-rise on Sunday, March 29, 1981, in Toronto, Canada. He stated to police that he had seen his wife on the balcony, reaching out over the rail to investigate a rattle. Kelly testified she then slipped and fell to her death. At Kelly's trial, the Crown had evidence that he was working with organized crime, namely money laundering. The prosecution experts testified that the great distance between the edifice and the location of Mrs. Kelly's body could have only occurred if she was strongly pushed.[1]  Kelly was arrested for his wife's murder on March 2, 1983. His trial began in April 1984. He was convicted by a jury and was sentenced to life in prison with parole eligibility after 25 years. The trial was covered extensively by Ontario and Canadian national news outlets. He was imprisoned at the federal inmate intake unit at Millhaven Institution for several years as a security precaution due to his past as an RCMP officer. He was eventually transferred to William Head Institution on Vancouver Island in British Columbia.

Kelly was given parole in May 2010.[2]  In November 2012, Kelly's federal parole was revoked, mainly because he had too many secretive relationships with women. He was returned to federal prison.[1] In 2016, he was given day parole and allowed to reside in Victoria, B.C.[3]",Wikipedia,

The jury was told that the victim, Lucie Gelinas, had phoned 911 less than a week before being gunned down, saying that Hotte had threatened to kill her.  Premeditation was a key issue in the trial. The defence argued that Hotte was guilty of manslaughter, not murder, because he was suffering from severe depression and had no memory of firing more than one bullet at the vehicle Gelinas was driving.

MR_18,"A coroner's inquest held in Baker Lake, Nunavut, last week has recommended police ""challenge assumptions"" about intoxication in Inuit communities.  The inquest investigated the October 2012 death of Paul Kayuryuk. The jury determined that he died of natural causes after medical care was delayed, because he was held in jail overnight on the assumption he was drunk.    Coroner's inquests do not determine who was at fault for a death, but they can make recommendations to prevent similar deaths in the future.  Kayuryuk was found unconscious at the landfill in Baker Lake and was taken into custody by RCMP, ""based on some level of assumption and some evidence he was intoxicated,"" the jury's written verdict said.    Over the course of the night, the verdict said three guards monitored Kayuryuk more frequently than normal, ""each with an increasing level of concern,"" because of his unconscious state.  By midday the next day, a medical examination was ordered based on information received from the family and concern from the guards.  Kayuryuk was diabetic and the doctor and nursing staff at the local health centre quickly determined he was experiencing a serious stroke.  He was medevaced to Winnipeg, where the prognosis was not good. He died in Winnipeg two weeks later from complications of the stroke. 
<p>Between July 24 and July 27, 2017,  coroner’s inquest in Baker Lake, Nunavut, examined the death in jail of Paul Kayuryuk in October 2012 and concluded that police must “challenge assumptions” about intoxication in Inuit communities. This after necessary medical attention was not provided Kayuryuk after RCMP jailed the man, who was having a stroke, on the assumption that he was drunk.</p>
<p>RCMP took Kayuryuk into custody after he was found unconscious at the landfill in Baker Lake.  Kayuryuk was observed overnight by three different guards and remained unconscious. It was only at midday the following day that a medical examination was ordered as a result of information received from the family. Kayuryuk was diabetic and the doctor and nurses at the local health center determined that he was experiencing a serious stroke. He was medivacked to Winnipeg but died there two weeks later from complications from the stroke.</p>

MR_23,"<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) the provincial body that investigates incidents of police harm to civilians in the province, is quickly developing a reputation for letting cops off on flimsy grounds when they are involved in civilian deaths.</p>
<p>On Friday, April 21, 2017 ASIRT announced that no officers from the Tsuut&#8217;ina Nation Police Service (TNPS) would be charged after a 25-year-old man in police custody apparently killed himself. This despite the fact that the ASIRT investigation found that the force did not follow the “specific protocols [which] were in place” for times when the man, who was known by police, was taken into police custody. According to the ASIRT ruling said “procedural errors” were made and the man was left unsupervised, which protocol said he should not have been “resulting in a sufficient amount of time to commit suicide” (ASIRT).</p>
<p>The man had been arrested on February 17, 2015, supposedly for intoxication and a complaint about his presence at a residence. So once again police were called to address a health care issue and the result is a civilian death.</p>
<p>ASIRT, which has an apparent habit of offering bogus excuses for officers and forces involved in civilian deaths, such as the dubious “excited delirium” claim, this time went one better. Their report attributed the man’s death to the vague and rather unscientific explanation of a “perfect storm” resulting in the man’s death. Surely this is clearly an ideological or copaganda mystification that excuses the officers involved for their own active choices and actions, the committing of procedural errors, and the role those played in contributing to the death. Yet the “perfect storm” means even a consideration of something like negligence is nullified. To the benefit of the police officers responsible.</p>
<p>ASIRT said in a statement that: “This case, however, should remind officers of the duty of care they undertake when exercising custody or control of another person” (ASIRT). Yet there is no mechanism to go beyond the occasional reminder when the investigative body keeps providing excuses to get cops off when civilians die in their custody.</p>
<p>Similarly,  in a statement, Chief Keith Blake of the TNPS said: “The Tsuut’ina Police remain absolutely committed to the highest levels of care for those persons in our care and custody” (Statement). Yet this case shows the lack of commitment to even basic standards of their own protocol. So one might well ask what it is they remain committed too.</p>

MR_25,"<p>The finding of “excited delirium,” which makes its primary appearance in medical contexts usually only ever as justification for police killings of civilians, is an ideological tool used to excuse lethal police force. It has been used by police forces as a way to simultaneously blame victims for their own killings and give killer cops an answer where no real answer exists.</p>
<p>This dubious piece of copaganda has been offered up once again in Alberta to excuse Edmonton Police Service officers who killed a 25-year-old man on April 29, 2015. This despite well established debunking of the notion of excited delirium. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) offered the excited delirium defense in findings released on April 18, 2017, two years after the young victim died after being subjected to force by multiple officers while in police custody.</p>
<p>Sadly, the victim was targeted by police for the trivial act of supposedly trespassing in the City Centre Mall after nervous security staff called them. The security staff had tweaked to him because they suspected him of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. So an effort at moral regulation by private security ultimately resulted in a young man having his life taken by police. The ASIRT report added to the moral regulatory approach by suggesting the man had been uncooperative with police, saying he refused to follow directions.</p>
<p>For many police officers refusing to follow directions is an invitation to a beating or worse an extrajudicial execution. In this case ASIRT reports that at least four officers used force on the man supposedly to get him into restraints. After being violently removed from the mall and taken into Downtown Division the man was placed on the floor in the detention area. At this point Edmonton Police Services officers noticed he was unconscious, and in medical distress. Paramedics took the man to hospital but he could not be stabilized and was declared dead there.</p>
<p>Notably, the ASIRT reports makes clear that the man was acting in a way that suggested both to private security and police that his issue was health related not criminal. According to the ASIRT release the man “exhibited bizarre behaviour” (ASIRT). The report continues: “He was observed twisting and attempting to pull away. He was observed to be breathing heavily, mumbling and yelling, mostly incoherently” (ASIRT). Yet the intervention was, once again, repressive violence and thuggish force rather than health care.</p>
<p>This is a case in which private security and police intervene against someone who is, at most, dealing with substance abuse issues. Police should not be intervening in this situation. Yet they do so with force. And when force becomes lethal they turn to “excited delirium” in an attempt to justify the unjustifiable. And it routinely gets them off. And mainstream media repeat the claim uncritically.</p>

MR_28,"<p>The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) mirrors other police oversight bodies in Canada in routinely and regularly letting police officers off the hook when they kill civilians. It is rare that they find against officers and rare that they recommend charges befitting the actions of officers. On June 13, 2017 ASIRT announced that they will not recommend charges against Edmonton police officers in the death of a 46-year-old man who died during a rough ride in a police van.</p>
<p>The incident followed the man’s arrest on October 25, 2015. Incredibly, the man had been jumped and held for police by members of the public who believed he had damaged cars in the area in north Edmonton. The man was initially taken to hospital but then released back into police custody. The following day the man was denied bail and was to be returned to the remand centre. Police put him on his back in the prisoner transport van with his legs elevated. Only a few blocks later, Edmonton police officers found the man unresponsive and not breathing.An autopsy later determined that the man died as a result of cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Toxicology results found there to be no alcohol, illegal drugs, or prescription medications in his bloodstream denying police some version of the “excited delirium” excuse. It turns out they did not need it.</p>
<p>According to ASIRT, the officers were performing the lawful execution of their duties. This should be a reminder that for police lawful execution of their duties includes lawful execution of civilians.</p>

MR_32,"<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, has decided not to recommend charges against a Leeds OPP (Ontario Provincial Police) officer who was involved in a high speed chase in May 2016 that ended in a crash near Smith Falls that killed a teenager in May 2016.</p>
<p>According to the SIU, the officer, who has not been named publicly, saw a vehicle, a Hyundai, allegedly speeding  on County Road 17 and turned around to follow it. With the police pursuit the vehicle turned down a dirt road into trees, killing the 18-year-old male driver. A 16-year-old girl who was a passenger in the front seat was not seriously injured. The SIU report suggests that the speeding car was going 100 km on a stretch of road with speed limits varying between 50 km/h or 80 km/h when the officer saw it, and around 170 km/h when it left the road.</p>
<p>SIU director Tony Loparco, who has rather consistently sided with police officers and forces in cases of harm to civilian since assuming his position, did raise concerns about the officer&#8217;s speed, reporting that  the OPP vehicle reached 165 km/h, and about the fact that the officer did not immediately notify the dispatcher of the pursuit. According to Loparco, each of these may have constituted a breach of the Ontario Police Services Act.</p>
<p>Yet Loparco decided that the officer’s actions did not meet the bar either for dangerous driving or criminal negligence. In his words: “There is no evidence that the [officer’s] driving created a danger to other users of the roadway or that at any time he interfered with other traffic; additionally the environmental conditions were good and the roads were dry.”</p>
<p>This is a curious statement given that the teen driver was driving at speeds less than the officer reached at the time the officer began pursuit. So if even the officer’s higher speed and the road conditions did not pose a threat to the public, why pursue a joy riding teen driving at lower speeds under the same conditions?</p>
<p>Loparco went further, suggesting that there was no causal connection between the officer’s pursuit and the crash. In his words: “I am unable to establish that there was a causal connection between [the officer’s] actions&#8230;and the single-vehicle collision that caused the&#8230;death.” Yet the stated evidence appears to suggest the teen both sped up and turned off the road in response to the officer’s pursuit and the closing speed of that pursuit.</p>
<p>The SIU assigned eight investigators to the case. Once again it appears the state has protected the state.</p>

<p>On August 14, 2018, the family of Tracy Janvier (41) launched a civil lawsuit against RCMP Constable Michelle Phillips, the RCMP, and the federal government in the 2016 killing of their loved one. Janvier was run over and killed by Phillips on Alberta Highway 881, about 80 kilometers south of Fort McMurray on August 21, 2016. The suit,  seeking $909,000, claims that Phillips was negligent and speeding, driving recklessly and carelessly when she struck and killed Tracy Janvier. Phillips also struck and injured a 71-year-old man.</p>

<p>It is, of course, rare for killer cops in Canada to be charged with criminal offenses for harming civilians. The state protects the state. One of those rare cases involves Alberta RCMP Constable Michelle Phillips. The constable has pleaded not guilty to two charges in the killing of 41-year-old Indigenous person Tracy Janvier on August 21, 2016. In June 2017, one count of dangerous driving causing death and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. Constable Phillips was charged with  The killer cop was not present in court when the pleas were entered by a lawyer on August 30, 2017. A preliminary inquiry is scheduled to be held in June 2018.</p>
<p>The charges came after an investigation by the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), the unit that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province. ASIRT concluded Janvier died as a result of being struck and killed by an RCMP vehicle traveling at “an extremely high rate of speed.” Constable Phillips had been responding to a call about an accident on the road in which Janivier, who had been struck by a previous vehicle, was being tended to by a 71-year-old man. Constable Phillips hit both the injured Janvier and the 71-year-old caregiver with her police vehicle at high speed.</p>
<p>At the time of the killing Constable Phillips had one year of service with the RCMP. RCMP have claimed the officers have been suspended with pay and will remain off duty until internal processes and all criminal charges against her are dealt with.</p>

MR_41,"<p>As this project has detailed repeatedly police across Canada act largely as they wish in investigations into the harms they inflict on civilians. This includes not even reporting those harms.</p>
<p>In September of 2016 a Hamilton police officer was involved in a vehicular pursuit that killed 20-year-old motorcyclist Chokha Bayez. Yet the Hamilton police broke the law and never reported the killing by the officer to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) as they are required to do. Every police service in Ontario is legally mandated to notify the SIU immediately of any incidents of serious injury, allegations of sexual assault, or death involving their officers (Carter 2017).</p>
<p>An SIU investigation into the Hamilton police killing of Bayez was only initiated when the victim’s family contacted the unit a month after the crash. This is an unacceptable delay that further serves to interfere with any proper investigation. As judge Michael Tulloch put it is his report on oversight in Ontario: ”In most cases, the SIU depends on the police notifying it of incidents within its mandate. Prompt, thorough police notification is the starting point for effective, efficient SIU investigations. If the police take too long to notify the SIU of an incident, or fail to do so at all, any investigation may be compromised and justice may not ever be done” (quoted in Carter 2017).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the investigation is not even listed on a Hamilton police report of SIU investigations presented to the police board earlier in April 2017 (Carter 2017). Constable Steve Welton told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) that the incident was included (despite saying he could not comment on the case and failure to report to the SIU). Oddly, according to the CBC, no vehicular death can be found in the police board report (Carter 2017). CBC News only became aware of the SIU investigation as a result of a freedom of information request listing all of the SIU&#8217;s investigations into Hamilton police officers from 2016 (Carter 2017).</p>
<p>As we have documented consistently in this project there is no proper independent oversight of police and no mechanism is used, legal or otherwise, to ensure there are any negative consequences for officers and police forces who fail to comply with investigative policy and requirements. Even where they violate or flaunt the law.</p>
<p>SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon told CBC News: “If the SIU Director is of the view that there may have been a breach of the regulation, and no charges are laid, it has been the Director&#8217;s practice to notify the Chief/Commissioner of his concerns in order that they may be reviewed” (quoted in Carter 2017). Of course the chief is under no obligation to act and it is unsure if such notice has even been given in this case.</p>
<p>André Marin, a former Ontario ombudsman and past SIU director, is clear in stating that under current conditions there is nothing to stop police from acting like this whenever they so choose. In his words: “Because there are no consequences, police can be extremely lax. They have proven themselves to be ungovernable” (quoted in Carter 2017).</p>
<p>Marin has a stark assessment of police services boards as well. In his view, while they could push for oversight:  “Police services boards should be vigilant and hold their feet to the fire — but they don’t care either. There is absolutely no excuse for this” (quoted in Carter 2017).</p>
<p>Again, the police are a law unto themselves. And the state always protects the state.</p>

MR_43,"<p>A woman has been killed when the van she was a passenger in collided with a pickup truck and rolled over during pursuit by Winnipeg police on Boyd Avenue near Sinclair Street in the Burrow’s neighborhood. The crash occurred on September 13, 2016. The victim was one of five people, including another woman, two men, one of whom was the driver, and a 17-year-old boy, who were in the silver van that crashed following initiation of police pursuit. The four other occupants of the van are in stable condition in local hospital. The driver of the pickup truck was also in hospital in stable condition.</p>
<p>According to Winnipeg police spokesperson Constable Rob Carver, whose statements have not been independently confirmed: “The incident appears to have started when a general patrol unit in the area observed the vehicle with five individuals in it and decided that there was a reason to initiate a traffic stop. Overhead lights were activated and … the vehicle immediately fled and collided with the half-ton” (quoted in CBC News 2016). Curiously Carver went on to suggest that “[w]hile it is a pursuit by a technical definition, we did not actually apparently pursue the vehicle” (quoted in CBC News 2016). However, a short pursuit is still actually apparently a pursuit nonetheless. And in this case one with fatal consequences. No other details have been released by police or independent witnesses. Police have not revealed why they decided to pursue the vehicle in the first place.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba, which examines all incidents of harm to civilians by on-duty and off-duty officers in Manitoba, is investigating this incident which resulted in the death of the woman passenger. The victim has not yet been named publicly.</p>

One victim who died during some type of struggle with an officer on October 12 has been identified as Russell Spence (31) of Winnipeg.

He became unresponsive at the center and was transferred to hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Names of victims have typically not been released by authorities but the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation learned of Spence’s identity on October 26. His family has come forward asking for information about the specific circumstances of his death.</p>
<p>Russell Spence has been described as friendly and harmless. In the words of his older brother Kevin Bittern: “Russell was a friendly giant. All his friends and everyone knew he would not hurt anybody, or start anything. I find this very suspicious about his death” (quoted in Taylor 2016). Bittern does not believe Spence was resisting because of the man’s previous experiences in dealing with police. He is upset that the family has been kept in the dark about the killing of their loved one. The family is seeking legal assistance and attempting to piece together Russell Spence’s last hours outside. They are looking for any witnesses to the police intervention against the victim.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigation Unit (IIU), the oversight body that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Manitoba, is investigating the death because the struggle was with either a police officer or a corrections officer.

MR_52,"<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in Canada, has let off a Brantford police officer for his involvement in a police chase that led to a collision that killed a 94-year-old woman and injured a 71-year-old passenger in November of 2016.</p>
<p>The officer turned on his cruiser’s lights and sirens in a an attempt to stop a Nissan after two men entered it from a house where an assault suspect was believed to be. Notably, the officer did not know one of the men was the suspect. In response to the officer’s actions the driver of the Nissan accelerated to try to get away, drove into an intersection, and collided head-on with a Honda, in which the two seniors were passengers. Investigators on scene later estimated that the Nissan was traveling 131 km/hr in a 50 km/hr zone before the collision.</p>
<p>The 94-year-old became unresponsive at the scene before paramedics arrived and was pronounced dead at hospital. The 71-year-old passenger suffered a broken sternum, a broken bone in her back, and two broken bones in her left hand.</p>
<p>The SIU reports that it was only after the driver was arrested that he realized it was the assault suspect. That raises questions about why the officer undertook the actions taken. As well it might have been assumed that the lights and sirens would provoke a response as the car was leaving a residence and it was not a routine traffic stop. The SIU did conclude that it was the officer’s actions that led to the collision but still decided to let him off.</p>
<p>Said SIU director Tony Loparco in his report: “I find that there is no evidence that the [officer’s] driving created a danger to other users of the roadway.” But clearly his actions did create a danger to others in the roadway as one person was left dead and another badly injured as a result. According to Loparco, the officer “was concerned that might cause a situation dangerous to the public.” Which it obviously did.</p>

<p>The family of influential artist Moses Amik Beaver is demanding answers after their loved one was found dead in his cell at the Thunder Bay Jail on Monday, February 13, 2017. The 59-year-old Beaver struggled with mental health issues and those close to him want to know why he was being held in jail and not a health care facility. Jails in Canada are too often used by the state as holding centers for Indigenous people in need of health care not punishment, even well after health care issues have been identified.</p>
<p>Local Indigenous leaders, including Johnny Yellowhead, chief of the Nibinamik (Summer Beaver) band in northwestern Ontario, where Moses Beaver’s family lived has called for a full public examination into Beaver’s death and what might have been done to help him. He could not say why Beaver was in custody but reported that he had expressed concern about depression and blackouts.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement released Thursday, February 16, 2017, Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of the Nishnawbe Aski First Nation said:</p>
<p>“The sudden and unexplained death of Moses Beaver was devastating to his family and everyone in Nibinamik. For Moses to die under these circumstances is troubling on so many levels, especially as his death has not been officially acknowledged by those responsible for his care. We are doing everything possible to support Chief and Council and the family of Moses Beaver, and we will demand an investigation into the circumstances around his passing.” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017b).</p>
<p>Said Chief Yellowhead: “Our dear friend Moses Beaver had struggled for many years with mental health issues but we do not understand why he was in custody or the circumstances that led to his death. It is clear that Moses needed professional help and a psychiatric assessment, and we demand to know why this didn’t happen” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017b).</p>
<p>Thunder Bay art gallery owner JP Fraser remembers the artists whose work his gallery has featured: “He was a very gentle person. He was a very warm, welcoming, outgoing and caring man. His painting skills will be a great loss to the artistic community. And what a waste of a life. He should have had treatment” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a).</p>
<p>Fraser identified the Thunder Bay Jail as the wrong place to hold someone with mental illness (a fact clear to many except police it seems). In his view: “It is just not a place for someone with mental-health issues” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a). One issue that emerges in city after city in Canada is that mental health services and funding are insufficient while police budgets continue to increase even as crime rates drop.</p>
<p>This point is emphasized by Johnny Yellowhead: “I wish there was better health care. He wanted to get better. He asked me to help” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a).</p>
<p>Thunder Bay Police and jail officials have refused to comment on either why Beaver was being held in custody or on the circumstances of his death. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services confirmed that there was a death in the jail on Monday but would not say more.</p>
<p>The Thunder Bay Jail is already quite notorious in the Canadian context. It is the very facility where Indigenous youth Adam Capay (23) was held in solitary confinement for more than four years before public pressure pushed provincial authorities to change his conditions.</p>
<p>Moses Amik Beaver painted in the vivid Woodlands style associated with Ojibwe artist Norval Morrisseau. He was well known for his depictions of spirits and animals, painted in vivid colors and outlined in black. He was also very much appreciated for his work with children in local schools.</p>

MR_93,"<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, is investigating after a 49-year-old woman was found dead in her home in Tichborne, Ontario, near Kingston. According to the SIU, the woman’s body was discovered at around 5:30 AM on the morning of Saturday, January 13, 2018.</p>
<p>Provincial police had had an earlier encounter with the woman when they came across what they described as a suspicious vehicle parked near Tichborne. The SIU report that the woman was found alive outside the vehicle, while the driver had allegedly fled on foot. According to the SIU, police took the woman back to her home and left. Four hours later emergency responders were called to the home where the woman was found dead. No other details have been provided publicly. It has not been reported publicly how the woman died or why police found the vehicle to be suspicious.</p>
<p>Tichborne, Ontario, is approximately 130 kilometers southwest of Ottawa.</p>

MR_94,"<p>A 34-year-old man has died following a period in care of the Regina Police Service in the morning of January 16, 2018. According Regina police, officers were dispatched to a residence in a south Regina neighborhood, on Pasqua Street, at around 6:30 AM. Police say they arrived on the scene and found the man in distress. He was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>There is no oversight body to investigate police harm to civilians in Saskatchewan. Police and the Office of the Chief Coroner will jointly investigate the death. The Regina Police Service has requested that the Ministry of Justice appoint an independent observer to provide oversight and review the investigation.

<p>The Special Investigations Unit (SIU, the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario) reports that the crash incident was initiated with a call from a man reporting that his daughter had been abused by a family friend at a Kanata hotel. This means the identity of the alleged suspect was known and under Ontario rules a police pursuit should not have been undertaken (where a suspect’s identity is known).</p>
<p>The SIU has designated one Ottawa police officer as the subject of its investigation, and also identified three other “witness officers,” two of whom are OPP officers. The agency assigned three investigators, two forensic specialists, and a collision reconstruction expert to its investigation team.</p>
<p>According to Ottawa defence lawyer Lawrence Greenspon, the main job for the SIU is to determine why the pursuit was launched given the identity of the suspect was known to police. While rules govern when a suspect should be pursued, Greenspon notes that too often those regulations are not followed. He outlines the too regular script followed by police:</p>
<p>“Every time there’s a crash like this it’s the same story: ‘We started the pursuit and it was stopped before the fatal collision took place.’ The big question here that needs to be answered is: Why were they chasing him in the first place? If they knew his identity, why start chasing him?” (quoted in Duffy, Yogaretnam, Gillis, and Miller 2019).</p>
<p>In Ottawa, the police service’s policy “requires that officers only engage in a pursuit if they believe a crime has been committed and if there’s no alternative for apprehending a suspect who poses a threat to public safety” (Duffy, Yogaretnam, Gillis, and Miller 2019).</p>

RCMP said they dealt with a “lengthy barricaded situation” starting at around 7 p.m.  They were called to a home because of concerns for a man and his partner’s well-being, with officers saying he had “numerous” firearms on him.  RCMP said the man barricaded himself in the house and refused to co-operate with police.

He was declared dead on the way to the hospital, according to​ police.  No officers or other people were injured.

MR_146,"	A man who was shot by police in rural central Alberta has died, officials announced Monday afternoon.  The 32-year-old was shot in a confrontation with police on Dec. 29 near Hardisty, Alta., some 200 kilometres southeast of Edmonton.  Sunday evening, RCMP only said they had been pursuing a vehicle involved in another incident when the confrontation happened, and at that time, the man had been taken to an Edmonton hospital with serious injuries.  On Monday, officials released more details surrounding the fatal shooting, including that the police chase started at about 5 p.m. near the intersection of Highways 13 and 41.  “The pursuit ended when the suspect vehicle drove over a spike belt and shortly thereafter ended up in a ditch on the south side of (Highway) 13 just east of Hardisty,” police said in a statement.  “A confrontation occurred between the driver and lone occupant of the vehicle, a 32-year-old man, that resulted in RCMP members discharging their service pistols, resulting in serious injury to the man.”  He is said to have died Sunday night at an Edmonton hospital. His identity has not been made public.  It is unclear how many shots were fired or by how many RCMP members.  Officials said Monday that a replica handgun had been found at the scene in the snow outside the suspect’s driver’s door.  The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team is investigating police members’ actions in the event.  Police say the pickup truck is believed to be the same one used to flee an RCMP traffic stop and ram a police vehicle multiple times Sunday morning.

MR_170,"Family members have identified a man killed during an officer-involved shooting in Edmonton Friday.  Edmonton police responded to a report of a man with a weapon at a home near 118 Avenue and 69 Street around 4:15 p.m. Friday. When officers arrived they got into an altercation with a man and fired their weapons. Emergency medical services (EMS) was called to the scene where the man was declared dead.  Marc Kassay said he was working in his garage a block away when he heard several loud pops.  Maureen Hyde, who lives nearby, said earlier the gunshots surprised and scared her.  “Sounded like my poor neighbour’s house blew, I’ve never heard that before,” said Hyde.  Amber Reid said Saturday that her cousin, Marty Powder, was the man who was killed. Multiple posts online also name Powder as the victim of the altercation, with one post questioning why police would need to fire multiple rounds at anyone.  Reid said she had only met Powder a few times and did not know any of the circumstances that led to his death.  Police have not confirmed Powder’s identity. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) has been directed to investigate the shooting.  Reid said Powder was the subject of an Edmonton Police Service release in July 2019 warning that he was being released from prison and was considered a violent offender.  The release stated Powder was known to commit offences against people he knew and did not know. He was released on conditions including a curfew from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., refraining from buying, drinking or being in possession of alcohol or drugs and not being able to leave the city of Edmonton without written consent.  He was also not allowed to be in licensed premises or enter into any romantic or sexual relationships without informing his partner of his past convictions.  Neighbours said police were regularly in the area and appeared to be checking on Powder.  Lance Reid, Powder’s nephew, said Powder was trying to turn his life around and he had been doing a good job of doing so.  “He was one of the most peaceful men I knew and a real role model to look to for getting out of the street life and off drugs and alcohol,” said Lance Reid.  “After his last conviction he dropped his gang ties and was living the sober life.”  The last time a person was killed in an Edmonton police officer-involved shooting was in January 2019.  Devlin Neyando, 26, died outside of an apartment near 47 Street and 101A Avenue just after 9 p.m. on Jan. 3, 2019, following what police described as a confrontation with officers.

Man critically injured in incident involving Toronto police   A man is fighting for his life in hospital after a confrontation with police in downtown Toronto on Tuesday morning. Share: Share Reddit Text:                         Chris Herhalt  Chris Herhalt, Web Content Writer, CP24	  @_Herhalt  Published Tuesday, February 23, 2021 5:53AM EST Last Updated Tuesday, February 23, 2021 4:19PM EST  A man is dead after he was shot during a confrontation with police at an apartment building in downtown Toronto early on Tuesday morning.  Paramedics said they were called to a Toronto Community Housing building at 291 George Street, north of Dundas Street East, at 3:50 a.m. for a report of a man with a severe injury to his chest.  He was rushed to hospital in life-threatening condition.  The Special Investigations Unit later said that police were called to building at 3:30 a.m., where they went to the third floor of building and confronted a 45-year-old man.  A source tells CP24 that heavily-armed emergency task force officers were the ones that confronted the man and fired on him.  The SIU says two officers fired at the man.  He was pronounced dead in hospital at 4:17 a.m., the SIU said.  Police said they were in the building as part of a missing person investigation when they learned of the possibility that someone inside may have had a gun.  Interim Toronto police Chief James Ramer told CP24 that officers are “simultaneously conducting a homicide investigation as a result of a person who was reported missing earlier,” regarding what transpired at the building, but he declined to elaborate.  “We were here and there was an interaction and as a result the SIU has invoked their mandate,” Ramer said.  In a news release issued late Tuesday afternoon, police said that officers had attended the building as part of their “inquiries into a missing woman.”  Police said that “investigators now have reason to believe a person has died under suspicious circumstance,” though it is not clear whether that person is the missing woman that police were looking for.  They are asking anyone who may have been in the building or in the area between Friday and Sunday to contact investigators if they heard or saw anything suspicious.  “A body has not yet been located and investigators continue to carry out inquiries to establish the full circumstances,” the news release notes.  The SIU is called to investigate any incident involving police and a member of the public that results in death, serious injury or an allegation of sexual assault.

<p>Almost 24-hours after Calgary Police Service officers shot and killed someone at the Nuvo Hotel, some additional details have been released by the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT). They report that Calgary Police Service officers attended a third-floor room at the Nuvo Hotel in response to a call placed by a woman who sounded distressed and was threatening self-harm.

They report that she returned and appeared in the doorway again, this time holding something that looked like a handgun.</p>



<p>The ASIRT report continues, curiously given that they claim to have reviewed bodycam footage:</p>



<p>“Further details regarding what the woman may have done with the handgun or what occurred thereafter are being withheld pending additional possible interviews; however, shortly thereafter, two officers discharged their service pistols. The woman was struck and fell back into the room.”</p>
