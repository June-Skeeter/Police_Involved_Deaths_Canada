In a statement Thursday, the B.C. RCMP said it has asked the Independent Investigations Office of B.C. to investigate an Oct. 13 incident between two men who knew each other, according to an RCMP statement.  Just before 8 p.m. PT on that day, Nass Valley RCMP were called to the 4300-block of Monroe Street in Gitlaxt'aamiks, formerly known as New Aiyansh, for a report that a man had stabbed someone.  By the time police arrived at the scene, the victim had already been taken to hospital, and neighbours were trying to calm the suspect, the statement said.  As officers tried to take the man into custody, he allegedly used his weapon on himself, it said.  One of the officers then used a stun gun to subdue him, but the suspect continued to struggle, RCMP said.  When there was no ambulance available, officers with the help of several bystanders, managed to get him into a police vehicle for transport to a local clinic where the man died.  RCMP said the IIO B.C. is now investigating to determine whether police actions are linked to the man's death, and no further information will be released.  Gitlaxt'aamiks is one of four Nisga'a communities in the Nass Valley area, located 97 kilometres northwest of Terrace and is home to approximately 1,800 residents.       **

       **<p>British Columbia RCMP shot and killed a man who has been identified by family members as Kyaw Din (54) at a Maple Ridge home on August 11, 2019. The killing took place at a home in the area of Colemore Street and 124 Avenue.</p>
<p>Family members have spoken publicly to say that the victim had a history of mental illness and had been between hospital and home over a period of some time. His brother Thant Din reports that Kyaw Din had forgotten or refused to take his medication the Sunday he was killed. According to Din: “In the past, my sister would call police, and police would come and take him to hospital. So today my sister called police, but he didn’t want to go” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Din reports that his brother had barricaded himself in his room and refused to leave when police arrived. He says that his sister asked that he and other siblings come to come to Maple Ridge from Coquitlam to help translate between their brother and police (Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Din recalls the frustration of conversations with police. In his words: “My sister told police, ‘Don’t do anything, they’re 15 minutes away, they’re on their way.’ When we show up, there’s police tape and we can’t go inside” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>He expresses his horror over police actions toward his brother: “They shot him. They shot him point blank. They unnecessarily killed someone” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Kyaw Din’s sister Yin Yin reports that she was told by police to wait outside the home. She then heard three shots. Incredibly, three officers came outside of the home “about an hour later,” but left the scene before she could talk with them (Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>She reports publicly her conversation with police: “They asked me if my brother has a gun. He doesn’t have a gun. He doesn’t have a knife. He’s just in the room and I told the police he has a glass bottle that he might throw at you. I don’t want you to get hurt and I don&#8217;t want the police to shoot my brother” (quoted in Holliday 2019).</p>
<p>She insists that police deceived her and the family: “They lied to me. They promised me, ‘we would never shoot your brother, we deal with this all the time,’ and they shot him” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>She is left only to ponder, in sorrow: “For no reason, they shot him. Can you imagine? Brother was doing housework in the morning and now he is dead” (quoted in Holliday 2019)</p>
<p>Thant Din Thant tells reporters that his brother was sometimes loud and confrontational when not taking his medicine, but he never saw Kyaw Din become violent. According to Thant Din: “He never hit anybody. He might be screaming and yelling, but he never hit anybody” (quoted in Holliday 2019).</p>
<p>Thant Din is angry and wants to see police held accountable for what happened. As he puts it, poignantly: “We’re heartbroken. To have a mentally ill person shot in his own home? It’s terrible” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>It has been reported by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the unit that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, that police officers also used a taser on the victim.</p>
<p>Police across Canada kill numerous people experiencing mental health issues every. Cops should not be responding to people in mental health crisis and resources should be moved from police to mental health and health care supports and resources.</p>

<p>According to the Independent Investigations Office of BC (IIO), the unit that examines cases of police harm in the province, police claim they responded to a report of a man with a firearm at the rear of the Walmart at 805 Boyd Street. The IIO reports that two officers at the scene fired their weapons. The encounter left the man dead. The IIO says it is investigating the cause of his death and whether the shots that caused the man’s death came from his own firearm or from those of the police at the scene.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the man was experiencing mental distress. No other information has been publicly released. It has not been independently confirmed that the victim had a weapon let alone discharged it.</p>

The crash occurred on the Trans-Canada Highway near Duke Point on the morning of January 14, 2019. The Nanaimo RCMP officer tried to pull over a white pickup which then crashed into a red SUV. According to the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm in British Columbia, the RCMP turned on the marked patrol car’s lights and sirens in an attempt to pull over the truck at around 12:40 AM.</p>
<p>The BC Coroners Service has confirmed that two people are dead as a result of the crash. Their identities have not been released. It has been reported publicly that the two people killed were the lone male drivers of each vehicle. It has also been reported that the driver of the red SUV was in his fifties.</p>
<p>According to Ron MacDonald of the IIO, the investigation will attempt to address several questions:</p>
<p>“That will include, were lights and sirens engaged? How long were they engaged for if they were? [What were the] speeds involved, distance and time involved? Was the attempt to stop the vehicle terminated at some point? If so, when did that occur in relation to the collision?” (quoted in DeRosa 2019)</p>
<p>MacDonald has also said that it is too early to say with certainty where the officer tried to pull over the truck. According to MacDonald: “How far apart the officer was from the vehicle at the time of the collision is, of course, an important factor for us to consider” (DeRosa 2019).</p>
<p>Police officers are not compelled to provide statements to the IIO. This has been an issue in previous IIO investigations and led the agency to sue the Vancouver Police Department to gain some cooperation in an investigation.</p>
<p>MacDonald has already said that gaining crucial information in this case is “going to be difficult without witness testimony” (DeRosa 2019). No details have been provided regarding why the officer targeted the white truck or why there was an attempt to pull it over.</p>

       **<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia, announced on October 2, 2017, that it is investigating an in-custody death in Quesnel, BC. The victim, identified as a woman, reportedly died only hours after being arrested by RCMP.</p>
<p>According to the IIO, RCMP officers claim they were called on reports of an assault early Sunday morning. Upon arrival they found a female victim who they decided to arrest for allegedly breaching a court-imposed condition. The victim was arrested and taken to the local RCMP detachment where police claim she was examined by paramedics before being taken to hospital. The woman died in custody Monday morning.</p>
<p>Police accounts have not been independently verified. No further details have been publicly released. Neither has it been explained why the victim of an assault was not treated as such and taken directly to hospital rather than arrested for an administrative offense and taken to the detachment. People detained over so-called administrative offenses make up a relatively large proportion of people incarcerated in British Columbia.</p>

       **<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the oversight body that examines cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia, is investigating after a woman was found dead in the Victoria suburb of Oak Bay around 9: 30 on the morning of Saturday, May 27, 2017. Police officers had some interaction with the woman Friday evening, hours before she was found dead but neither Victoria police nor the IIO are providing any more information to the public. This lends a curious air of mystery to the situation. The BC Coroners Service is also investigating. The victim has not been named.</p>

       **<p>The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the provincial body that examines cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia, is investigating the death of an as yet unnamed  40-year-old man who died while in Kelowna RCMP custody. RCMP claim officers responded to a single-vehicle crashing into a tree on McCulloch Road at around 5:15 PM on Friday, March 31, 2017. RCMP report taking the driver to the detachment in Kelowna as part of a criminal investigation, the nature of which has not been revealed publicly.</p>
<p>Police claim that the man was taken to hospital after complaining of pain. Following examination there he was, according to police, taken back to the detachment and booked into a cell at 11:25 PM. According to RCMP the prisoner was found unresponsive the next day at approximately 2:11 PM and was pronounced dead around 2:40 PM.</p>
<p>None of the police claims have been independently confirmed. The details of the prisoner’s death in RCMP custody, as presented by police, have not been independently verified.</p>

MR_101,2018-03-19,,,BC,Surrey,10 Ave & 161a St,V4A 1A8,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,,Male,Unspecified,,,,Unspecified,,,,,,"<p>A man died after going into medical distress during an arrest in South Surrey involving members of the RCMP and Vancouver Police Department (VPD) on the afternoon of March 19, 2018. Surrey RCMP report receiving multiple calls about a man apparently in some distress in the roadway near the intersection of 10 Avenue and 161A Street around 1:40 PM.</p>
<p>According to a media release by the Independent Investigations Office of BC, the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in British Columbia, the man went into medical crisis when RCMP “tried to gain control and take him into custody.” The man had reportedly first been confronted by an off-duty VPD officer. Emergency Health Services arrived and attempted to provide aid but the man was declared dead around 3 PM.</p>
<p>Once again the question must be asked why police were the ones sent to interact with someone in personal distress but posing no threat to the public. Questions must be asked about the role the off-duty VPD officer played in confronting the man initially.</p>

MR_51,2016-11-12,,,BC,Prince George,455 Victoria St,V2L 0B7,,Unspecified,,Unspecified,,,Male,Indigenous,,,,Unspecified,,,,,,"<p>In northern British Columbia a trip to the RCMP detachment can be a death sentence. Too many people taken into custody by RCMP, particularly in northern detachments do not leave again alive. Disconcertingly, many of the people arrested and detained in northern communities are targeted and picked up for nothing more than public intoxication. Disproportionately arrested and detention for public intoxication are imposed on poor people and Indigenous people at discretion of police. Unfortunately such a situation has happened once again in the norther city of Prince George as a man has died in custody during the early morning hours of November 21, 2016.</p>
<p>The victim was arrested earlier in the evening of the 20th for supposedly causing a disturbance while intoxicated. He arrested for public drunkenness and transported to the Prince George RCMP detachment. At around 2 AM the man was found unresponsive. Emergency Health Services were contacted and RCMP officers apparently initiated CPR. A bit before 3 AM the man was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office, the agency that investigates incidents of civilian harm involving police has sent investigators to Prince George to examine the death. The name and background of the deceased man have not been released publicly.</p>
       **<p>Vancouver Police Department officers have killed a man at a Canadian Tire store in East Vancouver on the afternoon of November 10, 2016. A police officer shot and killed the man after two officers responded to a call at the Canadian Tire at Grandview Highway and Bentall Street. Police claim a robbery was in process when they arrived. A second man was taken into custody. Few details have yet been released.</p>
       **<p>There is little expectation that officers who kill civilians in Canada will be in any way held accountable (even minimally). This expectation is even further diminished in cases in which police have killed social activists in the course of upholding or defending the state capitalist status quo. Clearly in such cases the officers are carrying out their fundamental purpose of maintaining dominant structures of social stratification and hegemonic order. And in this they must be assured full protection and legitimation. Thus it is almost certain that they will not be taken to task under such circumstances for killing someone who challenges that order or threatens to make a public show of reasonable opposition to established order.</p>
<p>The official investigation into the RCMP officers who killed Indigenous Anonymous activist James McIntyre while he was protesting the Site C dam megaproject in British Columbia and the conclusions drawn by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) is in no way surprising then. The IIO exonerated the officers involved including the cop who fired the shot that killed James McIntyre despite the fact that the officer failed even to file an internal report on the killing which is required under law. The IIO could only state with futility:</p>
<p>“As of the time this decision is being issued, it does not appear that the subject officer has completed any reports or notes of his recollection of the incident. The IIO has, and continues to engage with the RCMP on the necessity of officers completing timely reports.” (IIO 2016)</p>
<p>Adds the IIO spokesperson Marten Youssef: “They are required to write timely reports, timely accounts, detailing their account of what happened. It appears as of the time of writing this case that the subject officer in this investigation did not comply with that policy.” (quoted in Kurjata 2016)</p>
<p>And there is nothing to suggest that the killer cop received so much as a stern word or cross look for this violation, let alone any sort of actual punishment. Yet the IIO concludes that the officer did nothing wrong despite the absence of any report.</p>
<p>The failure of officers involved in the killing of civilians to file reports of to file reports in a timely manner is notorious in British Columbia, a fact the IIO has raised repeatedly. Indeed officers often watch media coverage before filing a report in those cases where a report is actually provided. Clearly police in the province view the legal requirements under which they are supposed to operate as something of a joke or at most a matter of personal convenience rather than a legal requirement of their job. As in other cases the officers view themselves as above the law—they are a law unto themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore there is no mechanism to compel officers to interview with the IIO in the course of its investigation. That is, officers choose whether or not they will interview with the supposedly independent investigation. One can well guess the choice killer cops tend to make. So in the case of the RCMP killing of James McIntyre the IIO had no interview testimony from the officer responsible for killing McIntyre.</p>
<p>Notably witnesses interviewed by the IIO varied in their accounts of how James McIntyre responded to police (approached, lunged, jabbing, coming towards, etc.). They were inconsistent in portraying the threat, if any, that the victim posed. There is no sense that James McIntyre posed a threat beyond police to the public. In addition the witnesses do make clear that James McIntyre was shot almost immediately as police told him to drop his knife (which some witnesses suggested was described as a “weapon” rather than a knife by police). Some witnesses noted having unreliable sight lines. One witness noted not being able to see after being hit by pepper spray from police (and before the fatal shot was fired). A witness officer admits that McIntyre only became agitated <em>after</em> being pepper sprayed. Yet the IIO somehow concluded that the officers did nothing to provoke McIntyre. Despite all of this the IIO wrapped their investigation and exonerated the officer, who remains unnamed.</p>
<p>Police did not even know until afterwards that McIntyre was not the man they had received a call about a protester at an event promoting the Site C project. That man was local farmer Terry Hadland. Hadland described his reasons for ripping up maps and turning over tables at the event: “I triggered the whole darn thing because I didn’t want Hydro to get away with smooching up to the public” (quoted in Kurjata 2016). He was deeply impacted by the police actions that killed James McIntyre. In his words:  “Oh, I was devastated. I felt awfully guilty. I could hardly believe that…it was surreal, especially as I began to realize it was me they were out for” (quoted in Kurjata 2016).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what response Anonymous might have to the conclusion of the IIO investigation. The <em>National Post</em> reports their interview with an Anonymous activist previously. The activist is quoted as saying there would be retaliation in the event of a cover up:</p>
<p>“Our message to whoever will be making those kind of decisions (is) that we are a very talented and patient and courageous crew and even if it takes us many months or many years to figure out what went wrong, we will sniff out your dirtiest laundry, procure it from wherever it’s hiding and find the highest flagpole in the windiest part of the public square and hang it up for everyone to smell and everyone to see.” (quoted in Humphreys 2016)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not a cover up, the IIO investigation certainly leaves important questions unanswered. While raising many others.</p>

1001_CRAP,2020-10-11,,,BC,Surrey,Fleetwood,V3R 3P3,,Jackson,,Diggle,,17.0,Male,Unspecified,,,,Gunshot,,,,,,"Persons who died following a police intervention;    VANCOUVER -- A watchdog investigation has determined police were not involved in the recent shooting death of 17-year-old Jackson Diggle.  The Independent Investigations Office spent one week looking into the case before announcing Friday that video evidence ""conclusively"" shows the teenager shot himself, and that he was the only one who opened fire.  Diggle died in hospital on Sunday, three days after sustaining a gunshot wound to his head in a parking lot in Surrey's Fleetwood neighbourhood. A Surrey RCMP officer was on scene responding to a report of a possible robbery in progress, which triggered the IIO investigation.   But the watchdog concluded the teenager's death was ""not the result of any actions or inaction by police.""  The officer was pulling up in a marked SUV when the youth opened fire on the vehicle, according to the IIO's investigation.  ""Before the vehicle came to a stop, the young man fired two shots, both of which struck the front of the police SUV,"" the watchdog said in a news release. ""Immediately after firing at the police vehicle, the video then shows that the youth turned the gun on himself.""  The police watchdog said the officer quickly backed the SUV away from the scene, and that it's ""clear based on the video evidence that at no point does the officer withdraw or discharge their firearm.""  The officer wasn't injured during the encounter.  It's unclear whether an actual robbery took place, but the IIO said it was Diggle who called and filed the police report.  The findings of the investigation raise questions about the teenager's state of mind at the time.  His distraught family previously told CTV News he didn't own a gun, and that they didn't believe he was suicidal. They said the teenager, who recently entered his graduating year of high school, was excited about learning to drive.  On Thursday night, more than 100 people gathered at the parking lot for a vigil marking one week since the teenager was fatally injured.  The circumstances surrounding Diggle's death are still being investigated by Surrey RCMP and the BC Coroners Service.       ***
<p>A man died after being tased by Nass Valley RCMP during an arrest in Gitlaxt&#8217;aamiks in the evening of October 13, 2020. The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm in British Columbia, is examining the death.</p>



<p>The IIO reports that officers from the Nass Valley RCMP detachment went to the 4300 block of Monroe Street in Gitlaxt&#8217;aamiks right before 8 PM on calls of an altercation between two men who knew each other. Police claim that when officers arrived, one man had already been taken to a local medical clinic for treatment of a stab wound and the other man “was being calmed by neighbours.” Police allege that before the man was arrested, he began harming himself. The police responded with violence, tasing him.</p>



<p>It has been reported that several civilians helped police to take the man not custody. He was then transported to the local clinic in a police vehicle. For some reason BC Emergency Health Services was not readily available according to the RCMP. The man died at the clinic.</p>

Everett Patrick was taken off life support on Friday and died early Monday morning at the Prince George hospital, according to his sister Miranda Thomas.   The Independent Investigations Office of B.C., which is responsible for investigating police-related incidents of death or serious harm, would not confirm Patrick's identity but said its team is investigating to determine what role, if any, the RCMP's actions or inaction may have played in his death.  Patrick was hospitalized on April 12 after being taken into police custody and went into ""medical distress,"" according details from the police watchdog organization.   Thomas said the grief of the situation has been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, which meant most family members couldn't be in hospital with him during his final days.   She said many of her final hours at the hospital were spent video-calling family so they could see and talk to Patrick.   ""Letting him go was really hard,"" she said.   Everett Patrick, a member of the Lake Babine Nation, was 42.         <p>Everett Patrick (42), a member of the Lake Babine First Nation, has died after being taken into custody by Prince George RCMP on April 12, 2020. Patrick had been hospitalized after going into “medical distress” while being arrested by RCMP. He was taken off life support on April 17 and died on April 20.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office of British Columbia (IIO), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, is investigating Patrick’s death. They report that the RCMP used a dog team to track Patrick down after allegedly responding to an alarm at a private business. They also say that Patrick was taken to hospital twice on the day he was arrested, first to be treated for what have been described as “minor wounds.” The nature of these wounds has not been confirmed publicly but it has been said that they were bites from the police dogs.</p>
<p>The IIO report that hours after being returned to the RCMP detachment from the hospital, Patrick “went into medical distress and was transported to hospital where he was found to be suffering from serious injury.” Miranda Thomas, Patrick’s sister, says that the family has been told that “he was having a seizure in the jail cell” (quoted in Bellrichard 2020).</p>
<p>Thomas says that doctors told the family that a CT scan showed that Patrick suffered “bleeding in his brain requiring emergency surgery and that he wasn&#8217;t expected to survive” (quoted in Bellrichard 2020).</p>
<p>The family has serious questions about what happened to Patrick while he was in RCMP custody and what caused him to be taken to the hospital for a second time the same day (Bellrichard 2020).</p>

The killing took place at a home in the area of Colemore Street and 124 Avenue.</p>
<p>Family members have spoken publicly to say that the victim had a history of mental illness and had been between hospital and home over a period of some time. His brother Thant Din reports that Kyaw Din had forgotten or refused to take his medication the Sunday he was killed. According to Din: “In the past, my sister would call police, and police would come and take him to hospital. So today my sister called police, but he didn’t want to go” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Din reports that his brother had barricaded himself in his room and refused to leave when police arrived. He says that his sister asked that he and other siblings come to come to Maple Ridge from Coquitlam to help translate between their brother and police (Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Din recalls the frustration of conversations with police. In his words: “My sister told police, ‘Don’t do anything, they’re 15 minutes away, they’re on their way.’ When we show up, there’s police tape and we can’t go inside” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>He expresses his horror over police actions toward his brother: “They shot him. They shot him point blank. They unnecessarily killed someone” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>Kyaw Din’s sister Yin Yin reports that she was told by police to wait outside the home. She then heard three shots. Incredibly, three officers came outside of the home “about an hour later,” but left the scene before she could talk with them (Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>She reports publicly her conversation with police: “They asked me if my brother has a gun. He doesn’t have a gun. He doesn’t have a knife. He’s just in the room and I told the police he has a glass bottle that he might throw at you. I don’t want you to get hurt and I don&#8217;t want the police to shoot my brother” (quoted in Holliday 2019).</p>
<p>She insists that police deceived her and the family: “They lied to me. They promised me, ‘we would never shoot your brother, we deal with this all the time,’ and they shot him” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>She is left only to ponder, in sorrow: “For no reason, they shot him. Can you imagine? Brother was doing housework in the morning and now he is dead” (quoted in Holliday 2019)</p>
<p>Thant Din Thant tells reporters that his brother was sometimes loud and confrontational when not taking his medicine, but he never saw Kyaw Din become violent. According to Thant Din: “He never hit anybody. He might be screaming and yelling, but he never hit anybody” (quoted in Holliday 2019).</p>
<p>Thant Din is angry and wants to see police held accountable for what happened. As he puts it, poignantly: “We’re heartbroken. To have a mentally ill person shot in his own home? It’s terrible” (quoted in Boynton 2019).</p>
<p>It has been reported by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), the unit that examines cases of police harm to civilians in the province, that police officers also used a taser on the victim.</p>
<p>Police across Canada kill numerous people experiencing mental health issues every. Cops should not be responding to people in mental health crisis and resources should be moved from police to mental health and health care supports and resources.</p>

1050_CRAP,2019-03-13,,,BC,Kamloops,560 Battle St,V2C 6N4,,Randy,,Lampreau,,49.0,Male,Indigenous,,,,Other,,,,,,"Persons who died following a police intervention      B.C.’s police watchdog has cleared Kamloops Mounties of any wrongdoing following the death of a man held overnight in the detachment’s holding cells in March.  Randy Lampreau, 49, died on the morning of March 13 from a health condition, but the actions of police during his time in custody fell within the standard of care expected, according to a report from the Independent Investigations Office of B.C. (IIO BC) released Thursday.  IIO representatives shared those findings with members of Lampreau’s family at a downtown Kamloops hotel on Thursday afternoon.  Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Lampreau’s sister-in-law, Lenora Starr, said the family is “dissatisfied” with the RCMP’s policies and procedures for the types of situations in which her brother found himself and would like to see them addressed, particularly by finding better ways to care for intoxicated individuals rather than putting them in jail. As a family, we’re going to do everything we can to make Randy’s passing not be for nothing,” Starr said. “We want to prevent other families from having to go through what we’ve gone through.”  Lampreau’s brother, Arnie Lampreau, said he thinks it’s clear his brother didn’t receive proper care.  “I think my brother, if he had the proper assessment, he should be alive today,” Arnie Lampreau said.  IIO chief civilian director Ronald MacDonald told reporters there was no use of force by police, describing interactions between the RCMP and Lampreau as “fairly co-operative.”  “The steps taken while in the cells to conduct regular checks was all done in accordance with appropriate practice,” MacDonald said. “Unfortunately, near the end of the evening, he suffered from a life-threatening condition … and some influence of the presence of drugs in his system, which caused his death.”  Lampreau’s autopsy showed he died from inflammation of the heart, with the level of methamphetamine in his system acting as another “significant contributing factor” in his death. It also showed he didn’t sustain any significant injuries that would have caused his death.  The IIO had no concerns regarding police action or inaction during Lampreau’s time in custody, which was captured entirely by video surveillance during his arrest, through the booking process and inside the detachment’s cells, the watchdog’s report stated.  Kamloops Mounties responded to a complaint from a business in the 100-block of Victoria Street downtown at 9:30 p.m. on March 12. The complaint concerned an apparently intoxicated man remaining at the business after he was asked to leave. Police arrived and found Lampreau in a nearby parking lot, where he was arrested under the Liquor Control and Licensing Act and taken to RCMP cells, to be released when he was able to care for himself.  In video from the booking area, Lampreau seemed to sway and stumble, with officers steadying him on several occasions to prevent him from falling, according to the IIO report.  Lampreau then walked with officers to a cell and was left sitting on the floor in the corner.  A civilian cell guard told the IIO he checked on Lampreau and other occupants regularly through the night.  When roused, Lampreau indicated “he was good” and asked when he could leave, to which the guard told him “not yet,” as he still appeared intoxicated.  While monitoring cell video, at about 1 a.m., the guard saw Lampreau fall backwards onto the floor and went check on him. He said he was reassured Lampreau hadn’t hurt himself.  Lampreau was roused again at about 2 a.m. and seemed fine, the guard recalled.  By about 3 a.m. Lampreau lay down and the guard assumed he was “sleeping it off.”  The guard said he did checks every 15 minutes — as required — either via video monitor or through the cell window, noting Lampreau appeared to be breathing or otherwise moving slightly.  However, shortly before 6 a.m., the guard said he noticed Lampreau hadn’t moved for some time, so he went to check on him.  The guard said he noticed Lampreau’s “colour wasn’t right” and it appeared there was a small amount of liquid coming from his mouth. The guard called an RCMP officer, who then called in paramedics, who were said to have arrived quickly.  Lampreau was pronounced dead shortly after they arrived  The IIO report stated the guard’s account of what happened was corroborated by the cellblock log book and video evidence.  MacDonald said this death raises the question of whether jail cells are the appropriate place to house intoxicated individuals.  “I think it’s a question that needs to be addressed right across the country,” MacDonald said, noting he has spoken to police agencies that share his belief that it’s not the appropriate setting.  MacDonald said it’s standard practice for police to hold intoxicated individuals in cells until they sober up and conduct regular checks.  “But those are done by, essentially, lay persons who don’t have medical training in most cases,” said MacDonald.  Starr said the family challenged the IIO to go above and beyond mere letters of support and to keep in touch with them regarding what else they can do to help address the issue of intoxicated individuals dying in police cells. She said they will also be speaking to the BC Coroners Service and will be seeking an inquest into RCMP policies and procedures.  “It’s going to be a bit of a process. It’s a long road for the family, but we want to make sure that there’s something good that will come from this for other families and individuals that are in similar situations,” said Starr.  In light of the death, the BC Civil Liberties Association is reiterating its call for the province to add more sobering centres throughout B.C. Members of Kamloops council have also expressed support for the establishment of sobering centres in the city.  While he can’t say if the availability of a sobering centre would have changed Lampreau’s fate, MacDonald said it is an alternative worth considering.",RCMP,,,,Randy Lampreau,la CRAP (2021),,,None,None,,,,Added,3.0,https://www.kamloopsthisweek.com/news/kamloops-rcmp-cleared-in-march-death-of-man-in-detachment-cell-1.23896884

Alcohol and cocaine in his system.;    Persons who died following a police intervention       ***<p>Police agencies and their ideological supporters, often located in criminology and psychology departments in universities and colleges, have developed entire cottage industries producing pseudo-science and pseudo-forensics, phony analyses, concepts, and terms, to justify and excuse police killings of civilians. These pseudo-scientific projects have constructed their own literatures, bodies of ideas, and “expert” witnesses supporting dubious “diagnoses” used to “explain” how it is that victims of police violence came to be responsible (biologically or psychologically) for their own murders.</p>
<p>Among the most pernicious and extensively developed and deployed of these pseudo-scientific diagnoses are the notorious notions of excited delirium and so-called suicide by cop. Neither of these has any scientific basis or legitimate supporting evidence to back them. They offer little, in fact, beyond the statements of police “researchers” (cops and former cops who have used such work not only to support their colleagues and former colleagues but to claim positions in academia) and some compliant criminologists and psychologists and others supportive of police on ideological or opportunistic grounds (i.e. funding).</p>
<p>While the dubious claim of excited delirium has no psychological or medical basis it is routinely used to let police officers walk away from any accountability when they kill civilians. Despite the recognition that excited delirium has no basis in scientific, psychological or medical, reality, it is still used in investigative cases on police killings, often by coroners’ offices in the Canadian context, for example.</p>
<p>In Canada the excited delirium excuse was used to let killer cops off the hook in two cases within a three week period over October and November of 2016. These cases involved the police killing of Maurizio Facchin (50) in Burnaby, British Columbia, in 2014 and Simon Chung (34) in Edmonton, Alberta, in 2013. Both cases involved the use of tasers by police and the men went into fatal distress only after a taser was used on them. Chung was also subjected to attempts by two Edmonton police to restrain him forcefully. He was tased twice by an officer while restrained, including one blast that lasted 28 seconds (Parsons 2016). In both cases the role of the taser in the men’s deaths was acknowledged yet both deaths were ruled accidental.</p>
<p>Notably in the case of the police killing of Simon Chung one of the officers claimed to suspect that the victim was experiencing excited delirium yet chose to restrain and taser him anyway. This would suggest culpability in his death given the claims of police that excited delirium could lead to a fatal response to either restraint or tasing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dubious Diagnosis of Excited Delirium</p>
<p>Excited delirium has come under growing public scrutiny in recent years given the overwhelming proportion of diagnoses related to deaths involving police use of compliance holds and/or use of tasers. Typically these diagnoses are provided only by medical examiners not by hospital or emergency room doctors. Furthermore, and as alarming, there is the fact that excited delirium is presently not a recognized medical or psychiatric diagnosis by either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IVTR) of the American Psychiatric Association or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) of the World Health Organization. Due to these troubling facts, it is widely considered that the real cause of death in cases identified after the fact as instances of excited delirium are actually caused by straightforward police violence and use if force. These are related to taser use and positional asphyxia.</p>
<p>Civil rights groups have argued that diagnoses of excited delirium are only applied after the fact to get police officers off the hook in cases in which excessive force has resulted in the death of a civilian. The NAACP reported in 2003 that excited delirium diagnoses are provided more often in explaining the deaths of minorities than they are in the deaths of white victims. In 2007, Eric Balaban of the American Civil Liberties Union noted that excited delirium was not recognized by the American Medical Association or the American Psychological Association and that the diagnosis simply served “as a means of white-washing what may be excessive use of force and inappropriate use of control techniques by officers during an arrest” (NPR 2007). Melissa Smith of the American Medical Association confirmed in 2007 that the association had “no official policy” on the supposed condition (ABC News 2007).</p>
<p>Excited delirium is not recognized in Australia by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, the Australian Medical Association or any other registered medical body. Neither is it recognized in law. A 2015 case, in which a man who had been declared to have died from excited delirium was overturned by a ruling in the Victorian Coroners Court. The presiding coroner in that case concluded that neither excited delirium nor so called excited delirium syndrome are appropriate or helpful in providing a legitimate medical cause of death (Coroner’s Court of Victoria at Melbourne 2015).</p>
<p>The Burnaby ruling in the Mauricio Facchin case is particularly stunning, and disappointing, given that Vancouver was site of the 2007 police killing of migrant Robert Dziekanski whose death police initially lied about publicly suggesting he suffered excited delirium. Video by a civilian witness showed this claim to be untrue as Dziekanski was following police instructions when he was tased and jumped by police causing his death. During the inquiry into police actions that police psychologist Mike Webster that police have been “brainwashed” by Taser International to justify “ridiculously inappropriate” use of the weapon. Webster referred to excited delirium as a “dubious disorder” pushed by Taser International during its police training (Hall 2008). A 2008 report on taser use by the RCMP, <em>An Independent Review of the Adoption and Use of Conducted Energy Weapons by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police</em>, concluded that excited delirium should not be included in the operational manual for the Mounties in the absence of formal approval following consultation with a mental-health-policy advisory body (Kiedrowski 2008). Justice Thomas Braidwood concluded the inquiry finding that excited delirium should not be used as part of police use of force training as it is not a legitimate medical condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommendations Based On What?</p>
<p>In the case of the coroner’s inquiry into the police killing of Maurizio Facchin, the coroner’s jury suggested that police receive training in identifying and properly responding to instances of excited delirium. It was also recommended that 911 dispatchers receive such training so that they might identify and inform police of potential excited delirium cases upon dispatch. Finally the jury suggested that officers contact emergency services when a taser is going to be deployed in such cases.</p>
<p>In the case of the police killing of Simon Chung, Provincial Court Judge Lloyd Malin provided two recommendations. In the first he suggested that while Edmonton Police Service mentions excited delirium syndrome in its policy and procedure manual on use of force, officers should also be trained to recognize the symptoms in all situations, not only during arrests. Malin also recommended that officers be trained to call for emergency medical services as soon as excited delirium is suspected. This call should be made regardless of the need for police to restrain an individual (Parsons 2016).</p>
<p>These recommendations are based on the dubious diagnosis of excited delirium and will do little to change police behavior, particularly violent behavior. They will not address police killings of civilians. The recommendations are based on treatment of a social fiction.</p>

       ***<p>In a September 2014 incident near Valemount, British Columbia, RCMP Emergency Response Team members fired several shots killing 51-year-old John Buehler and injuring his daughter Shanna Buehler. All of this happened in an attempt to arrest the man simply for failing to appear in court. Following an investigation by the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) the Criminal Justice Branch in BC decided, for reasons that are not yet clear, not to lay charges against the four officers involved in the multiple shootings and killing. This despite the finding by the IIO investigators that Buehler did not shoot at officers as police claimed. Still the Crown decided not to pursue a case against the officers and little more has been said about the attempt by police to justify the shootings and killing by falsely claiming they were only returning fire. The announcement of no charges was released on October 20, 2016, more than two years after the killing.</p>
       ***<p>After more than a year, a period in which few details have been provided to the public or family, the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) in British Columbia has finished its report into the police killing of 20-year-old Hudson Brooks. The young man was shot and killed by an officer outside the RCMP detachment in South Surrey on July 18, 2015, under mysterious circumstances which have long called for insight and answers. The report has been forwarded to Crown prosecutors for consideration suggesting charges could be laid against an officer or officers involved.</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks was killed while approaching the RCMP detachment in South Surrey. He was intercepted by police on 152 Street in the early morning of July 18, 2015. He was unarmed and wearing shorts and flip-flops when an officer initially targeted him for unknown reasons. Witnesses have suggested Brooks may have been experiencing some distress and seeking assistance at the time. He was shot and killed a short time after the approach by police. Early reports noted that an officer had been shot, in what seemed an attempt to legitimize police actions in the public eye. It has since been revealed that no weapon other than those of police was found on the scene and it is believed the officer’s injury was police inflicted (perhaps even self-inflicted).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consideration of Charges?</p>
<p>The IIO report has been forwarded to the Crown prosecutors for consideration of charges. This is only done in cases in which the IIO has determined that an officer involved in harm to a civilian may have committed a criminal act. In the words of IIO spokesperson Adan Buckley:</p>
<p>“At the conclusion of an investigation, if the chief civilian director of the IIO concludes that an officer may have committed any offence, then the chief civilian director will refer the case to crown. If it&#8217;s concluded the officer has not committed any offence, then the chief civilian director will publish a public report.” (quoted in Johnstone 2016)</p>
<p>While there is some relief in the consideration of charges in this case and the possibility that relevant details about the actions of police the night Hudson Brooks was killed by RCMP, there is little to suggest that police will be held accountable in any meaningful way. It is extremely rare in the Canadian state for officers to be charged when they kill civilians, even under the most clearly dubious and egregious circumstances. The state tends to protect its frontline forces. And Crown prosecutors appear reluctant to jeopardize the close relations they have with police on whose efforts their own success and careers partly depend. Over the brief history of the IIO in British Columbia, 56 reports have been forwarded to Crown for consideration of charges. Those 56 reports have resulted in charges only nine times, a tiny fraction of cases. Five cases remain undetermined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Justice for Hudson”</p>
<p>Hudson Brooks’ family has worked tirelessly to get answers about the actions of police in killing their loved one. According to his mother Jennifer Brooks: “I wouldn’t say I’m shocked because I really, really believed that this would go to Crown. I was just so happy that they closed it, because it was such a long, long wait” (quoted in Johnstone 2016).</p>
<p>Family and friends have organized a movement for “Justice For Hudson” to raise awareness about Hudson’s killing by police and to gain some sense of accountability for the force and officers involved. They have organized several rallies and marches in South Surrey and outside the RCMP detachment where Hudson Brooks was killed. These have been mass events with hundreds of people participating. This is in many ways unique in the Canadian context where ongoing rallies and protests over police killings have been less common and certainly received less media coverage and public attention than has been the case in the United States. This too s changing as a younger generation in particular has mobilized against police violence in the Canadian state.</p>
<p>The Justice for Hudson movement will continue as the case goes forward to the Crown. In the words of Jennifer Brooks: “We’re not going to wait for six months, seven months or eight months. If we have not heard anything within three months, we will plan another march because we really, really demand justice for Hudson” (quoted in Johnstone 2016).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if any of the officers involved will be brought to trial. The history in British Columbia and in Canada leaves little cause for optimism</p>

The statement described an in-custody suicide attempt by Tucker about a month before he died, which also involved on overdose of prescribed opioids.  Brennan said she had tried to talk Tucker out of killing himself and called the Surrey Pretrial Centre July 20, 2016 to warn officials about the suicide threat.  She testified that she told officials to listen to recordings of the phone call she had with Tucker, detailing his plans.

1048_CRAP,2016-06-24,,,BC,Port Alberni,4444 Morton St,V9Y 4M8,,Jocelyn,Marsha,George,,18.0,Female,Indigenous,,,,Unspecified,,,,,,"Persons who died following a police intervention;    <p>In the Canadian context too little attention is given to deaths that occur in police custody. Little is revealed about the circumstances of the deaths and too many questions are left unanswered. This is particularly the case in deaths of Indigenous people in police custody in Canada, occurrences which have been too frequent and too frequently passed over by media and academics alike.</p>
<p>Serious questions remain to be answered regarding the in custody death of Jocelyn Nynah Marsha George (18), a member of the Ahousaht and Hesquiaht First Nations, on the evening of June 24, 2016. The young Indigenous woman died while being held by the RCMP in Port Alberni. She had been arrested on June 23 for uncertain reasons. The BC Coroners Service reported that George was taken to Westcoast General Hospital the next morning “in need of medical attention” of an undisclosed nature. She was then taken by air ambulance to Victoria&#8217;s Royal Jubilee Hospital and died there on the evening of June 24. The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), which investigates all incidents of violence by police against civilians in British Columbia, are investigating.</p>
<p>Jocelyn George’s family members want to know why their loved one was left alone in the cell by RCMP and for how long. They also want to know if or when officers checked on her while she was being held. They would also like to see any video footage from the detachment (Zussman 2016b).</p>
<p>The family reports that Jocelyn George was taken into custody for a “disturbance” and was left alone in her cell. This raises real questions about police interactions with indigenous people, particularly indigenous youth. It is well documented that Indigenous people are responded to more punitively by police and are detained disproportionately to non-Natives in Canada (see Monchalin 2016). That Jocelyn George was taken into custody over a disturbance should raise flags about issues of police discretion, possible racism or profiling, and punitive policing.</p>
<p>Doctors at the hospital stated that they found a mix of drugs and alcohol in the teenager’s system which may have damaged internal organs. There is no sense yet why the police did not provide care and attention to someone who may have been experiencing distressed health. The family wants the IIO investigation to place focus on the ways in which police officers treat people dealing with addictions and health issues while in custody (Zussman 2016b). She apparently needed help but did not receive it.</p>
<p>George’s uncle Linus Lucas notes the ongoing impact of state violence and the residential school system on the family. These are the histories of Canadian colonialism and genocide that have devastated Indigenous communities and families and in which the RCMP were, and continue to be, central figures. This further informs questions about the lack of attention, care, or compassion George received while in custody. According to Lucas:</p>
<p>“In some ways I’m saying it’s not surprising where she ended up, given our own family history. Both my parents are survivors of residential schools. You only know how to deal with things in one manner, and that’s get angry and say what the hell is wrong with you, get your act together, and you are yelling..It just got her more determined to say, ‘I don&#8217;t have to deal with you and I will do what I want, just leave me alone,’ and it just got harder and harder for us to deal with.” (quoted in Zussman 2016b)</p>
<p>Two young children, four months and three years old, are left without their mother. She is fondly remembered by family members who recall a sweet girl. According to Christopher Cenmane, the father of her four-month-old daughter: “She was too young to say goodbye. I will always love her. I will always have her living in my heart. She is young, beautiful, smart. She will always be my love” (quoted in CBC 2016).</p>
<p>Incredibly, but in manner too common in cases of police involved deaths of civilians, the family was not even notified by police that their loved one had been taken to hospital. The family reports that they would not have known at all about the situation if an Indigenous hospital worker had not called to tell them (Zussman 2016b).</p>
<p>In the words of the victim’s cousin Lee Lucas: “We know she was brought in and they said she was okay, and she was found in the morning. Our main concern is to find out what happened in the time between when she was arrested and when the ambulance picked her up” (quoted in Zussman 2016a).</p>
<p>The family hopes the investigation will address police protocols for interacting with people dealing with addictions and/or health care issues. According to Lee Lucas: “If things can change from this, if cop protocols can change from this when they bring someone in who has issues like this&#8230;You have got to look at how they are brought in and why they are not checked out” (quoted in Zussman 2016a). Again questions remain to be asked why police are taking custody of people in health crises and why alternative care and support are not made available rather than police and detention. And why are police allowed to impose penalty and punishment in these cases in any event?</p>
<p>Jocelyn George’s cousin further points out that such punitive policing is especially deployed against Indigenous people and it is taking a brutal toll. In her words: “Sometimes things have to change because this is happening far too much especially for our people in this province” (quoted in Zussman 2016a). Change must come and directly.</p>
<p>Anyone waiting for or expecting answers or police accountability from the IIO are likely to be disappointed. The agency, which has a connection with training through the Justice Institute of BC police academy has taken exceedingly long times to complete investigations and does not have a good record of finding against police involved in civilian deaths in the province.</p>

<p>It has not been independently confirmed that Culver, or anyone else was “casing vehicles.” Yet on this basis he was killed by police. A terrible price to pay for simply being suspected of possibly looking at cars.</p>
<p>Seeing the video, Alicia Wisla, Culver’s partner and mother of their five-month-old child, insists the officers involved must be charged.</p>

The Independent Investigations Office, set up to address the use of lethal force by police in the province has in its few years of existence shown the perils and limitations of such would be oversight efforts. As in other cases issues of independence, and fortitude in the face of police backlash have come to the fore.</p>
<p>There are currently only five police oversight agencies in Canada. This is a small minority in a country with ten provinces and three territories. The first such oversight agency was established in Ontario, the country’s largest province, in 1990. Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is still viewed by many as the model such agency, nationally and, for some, globally, despite ongoing, well documented, structural limitations and continued interference and non-participation by police. The next oversight agency came almost a decade later when the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) was established in 2008. The Nova Scotia Serious Incident Response Team was set up in 2012, the same year that the IIO was established in British Columbia. In 2013 Manitoba set up the Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba.</p>
<p>The Independent Investigations Office in British Columbia was created in response to recommendations resulting from two public inquiries into police involved killings, including the infamous police killing of Robert Dziekanski in which police lied publicly about events of the killing before a civilian video appeared to show police claims to be bold lies. The mandate of the IIO is to probe all police-involved incidents that result in death or serious harm. The IIO currently consists of 34 investigators. This includes team directors, forensics staff, affected-persons liaisons, and public accountability staff.</p>
<p>The first few years of its existence has been rocky, to put it in its nicest possible light. The IIO began operations a year later than planned (Sept. 10, 2012) and over its first few years has suffered a range of problems and missteps. These include questions about its framework, low morale, high attrition, and ongoing concerns about how the office has investigated some of its cases. Allegations that chief civilian director Richard Rosenthal was harassing and bullying staff led to an investigation by the British Columbia government. Stunningly, 22 of the IIO’s 50 employees quit or were fired in the first two years (Saltman 2016).</p>
<p>The IIO staff recognize that the first few years have been a struggle and much work still needs to be done. The next chief civilian director of the IIO enters the position in 2017. According to current chief civilian director Richard Rosenthal: “We’re four years old. Hopefully we’re not sticking our fingers in electrical outlets, but we’re still very young, we’re still emerging, we’re still developing. Nobody can say what this organization is really going to look like 10 years from now” (quoted in Saltman 2016). Yet the newly developed directions in IIO training and practices raise real questions about its future as anything approaching an effective police oversight agency.</p>
<p>The IIO has appeared to capitulate to criticism over cases that have found against police officers. Those cases have been responded to by a great deal of public propaganda by police officers, agencies, and supporters. This media flak by police associated sources has been effective in putting the office on the defensive. Senior director of investigations, Patrick Kennedy suggests: “Civilian oversight is challenging because you have to look at it from a different perspective and a different paradigm” (quoted in Saltman 2016).</p>
<p>In response to police initiated criticisms the office has planned a new training program introduced in February 2016 involving the swearing in of seven new investigators. Under the new training program, investigators now complete a six- to eight-week induction and then spend three months training at the Justice Institute of B.C. Yet the Justice Institute is the police training institution in British Columbia. It is part of and central to policing in the province. Instructors are typically police officers, many of whom are currently active on the force. This is in no way independent training and it raises fundamental questions about investigators’ relationships with and commitments to their instructors, the institution, and the police forces in British Columbia. Investigators will work cases for 12 to 18 months before they can act as primary investigators. While the IIO states its hope that the training will help the organization move toward one day being completely staffed by civilians, this raining program largely undermines this stated hope. Notably the “independent” investigators have expressed satisfaction with the new arrangement.</p>
<p>The records related to the cases within the Independent Investigations Office are quite telling: There have been 156 cases investigated by the IIO since the office opened in September 2012. Forty-four cases remain open. There have been 112 cases that have been closed. Of those closed cases, 48 resulted in reports to Crown counsel and 64 resulted in public reports exonerating the officers involved. An improbably low number of seven cases have seen any charges approved by the Crown. Of these, two cases resulted in stays of proceedings, two resulted in pleas, one resulted in an acquittal, and two are pending. The office has probed 29 officer-involved shootings. In 17 cases, the shootings were fatal while the rest of them resulted in serious harm. Between September 2014 and September 2015 alone there were 20 fatalities that the IIO was called to investigate. Twelve of these involved shooting deaths of civilians by police (Saltman 2016).</p>
<p>Among the greatest current worries about the IIO has been the backlog of cases that has quickly built up in a short period of time. The office presently has 44 open cases, an incredible 10 of which are more than one year old. This has made things very difficult and painful for victims harmed by police and for families of victims killed by police. It has also put pressure on Crown prosecutors in making decisions about charges, already a rare circumstance in police involved killings. Incredibly, the IIO blames the backlog on the large increase in police involved killings (which the IIO was instituted to help reduce).</p>
<p>There have also been concerns about the limited mandate and limited definitions of police involved harms. Currently domestic violence and sexual assaults by police are not included within the IIO mandate for investigations.</p>

Photo from an online tribute to Adam Palsson. Article content  Colby Palsson is looking for answers after his son Adam was killed last month while in the custody of B.C. Corrections.  Adam, 27, was serving a 13-month sentence at the Fraser Regional Correctional Centre for stealing a car and driving dangerously.  He was in protective custody, meaning he should have been secure, the elder Palsson said in an interview Tuesday.  The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, which is looking into the slaying, said Adam died after an altercation on the afternoon of Feb. 27.  “IHIT didn’t really say any names to me. They just told me that at this point there are no charges being laid,” Palsson said.  He said he’s learned the attack on his son happened during lockdown for a shift change of the guards at the Maple Ridge institution.  “I believe they should be watched a little better when guards go on breaks or when they are on lockdown. You are supposed to be in your rooms and you’re supposed to be safe in your rooms. But how safe are you when there is nobody around to make sure you’re safe?”  IHIT Sgt. Stephanie Ashton said Tuesday that there’s no update in the investigation.  Earlier she said “IHIT investigators are working in partnership with corrections personnel at FRCC to determine the circumstances leading up to this man’s death.”  “Investigators believe there may be witnesses with information about what led up to this in-custody death and ask anyone who has not already spoken to police to come forward,” she said.  B.C. Corrections official Cindy Rose offered condolences to Adam’s family in an emailed statement to The Vancouver Sun.  “Any death in custody is a tragedy and I can assure you that each and every one is taken extremely seriously,” Rose said. “While we certainly appreciate that the individual’s family is seeking answers at this difficult time, we can only offer very limited details given the investigations that are currently underway.”  She said the government agency takes “every precaution to ensure inmates’ safety.”  “We will be looking at the circumstances of this incident to determine if there are ways to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future.”  Palsson learned of Adam’s death from a friend on Facebook. At first he thought it was a practical joke.  “He died from a smash to the head. So I don’t know if he fell down and hit his head on something or his head was smashed into something or if it was a hit,” Palsson said. “It is still kind of surreal. I hadn’t talked to Adam in a couple of months. I still get this feeling I am going to see him in a month or so, because he was supposed to be out soon.”  His son was a prolific car thief who struggled with a drug problem, he said.  “He had promise. He just kind of lost his way a bit with the party life, I guess, and doing things like stealing cars. Just minor breaches and missing his appointments,” said the grieving dad.  He said he’d like to see changes to jail regulations or even laws, if necessary, to ensure inmates at provincial jails are kept safe.  “If I can step in and make some changes I will — positive changes for the future,” Palsson said. “I don’t want this to ever happen to anybody else just because they aren’t looking after them properly in jail.”",Fraser Regional Correctional Facility,,,,Adam Palsson,Georgia St (2017),,None,None,None,,, ***177_KCC,Added,2.0,https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/dad-looking-for-answers-after-son-killed-in-maple-ridge-prison
